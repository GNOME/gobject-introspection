/**
 * GBytes:
 *
 * A simple refcounted data type representing an immutable sequence of zero or
 * more bytes from an unspecified origin.
 *
 * The purpose of a #GBytes is to keep the memory region that it holds
 * alive for as long as anyone holds a reference to the bytes.  When
 * the last reference count is dropped, the memory is released. Multiple
 * unrelated callers can use byte data in the #GBytes without coordinating
 * their activities, resting assured that the byte data will not change or
 * move while they hold a reference.
 *
 * A #GBytes can come from many different origins that may have
 * different procedures for freeing the memory region.  Examples are
 * memory from g_malloc(), from memory slices, from a #GMappedFile or
 * memory from other allocators.
 *
 * #GBytes work well as keys in #GHashTable. Use g_bytes_equal() and
 * g_bytes_hash() as parameters to g_hash_table_new() or g_hash_table_new_full().
 * #GBytes can also be used as keys in a #GTree by passing the g_bytes_compare()
 * function to g_tree_new().
 *
 * The data pointed to by this bytes must not be modified. For a mutable
 * array of bytes see #GByteArray. Use g_bytes_unref_to_array() to create a
 * mutable array for a #GBytes sequence. To create an immutable #GBytes from
 * a mutable #GByteArray, use the g_byte_array_free_to_bytes() function.

/**
 * GCond:
 *
 * The #GCond struct is an opaque data structure that represents a
 * condition. Threads can block on a #GCond if they find a certain
 * condition to be false. If other threads change the state of this
 * condition they signal the #GCond, and that causes the waiting
 * threads to be woken up.
 *
 * Consider the following example of a shared variable.  One or more
 * threads can wait for data to be published to the variable and when
 * another thread publishes the data, it can signal one of the waiting
 * threads to wake up to collect the data.
 *
 * Here is an example for using GCond to block a thread until a condition
 * is satisfied:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer current_data = NULL;
 *   GMutex data_mutex;
 *   GCond data_cond;
 *
 *   void
 *   push_data (gpointer data)
 *   {
 *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
 *     current_data = data;
 *     g_cond_signal (&data_cond);
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
 *   }
 *
 *   gpointer
 *   pop_data (void)
 *   {
 *     gpointer data;
 *
 *     g_mutex_lock (&data_mutex);
 *     while (!current_data)
 *       g_cond_wait (&data_cond, &data_mutex);
 *     data = current_data;
 *     current_data = NULL;
 *     g_mutex_unlock (&data_mutex);
 *
 *     return data;
 *   }
 * ]|
 * Whenever a thread calls pop_data() now, it will wait until
 * current_data is non-%NULL, i.e. until some other thread
 * has called push_data().
 *
 * The example shows that use of a condition variable must always be
 * paired with a mutex.  Without the use of a mutex, there would be a
 * race between the check of @current_data by the while loop in
 * pop_data() and waiting. Specifically, another thread could set
 * @current_data after the check, and signal the cond (with nobody
 * waiting on it) before the first thread goes to sleep. #GCond is
 * specifically useful for its ability to release the mutex and go
 * to sleep atomically.
 *
 * It is also important to use the g_cond_wait() and g_cond_wait_until()
 * functions only inside a loop which checks for the condition to be
 * true.  See g_cond_wait() for an explanation of why the condition may
 * not be true even after it returns.
 *
 * If a #GCond is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call g_cond_init()
 * on it and g_cond_clear() when done.
 *
 * A #GCond should only be accessed via the g_cond_ functions.

/**
 * GRWLock:
 *
 * The GRWLock struct is an opaque data structure to represent a
 * reader-writer lock. It is similar to a #GMutex in that it allows
 * multiple threads to coordinate access to a shared resource.
 *
 * The difference to a mutex is that a reader-writer lock discriminates
 * between read-only ('reader') and full ('writer') access. While only
 * one thread at a time is allowed write access (by holding the 'writer'
 * lock via g_rw_lock_writer_lock()), multiple threads can gain
 * simultaneous read-only access (by holding the 'reader' lock via
 * g_rw_lock_reader_lock()).
 *
 * It is unspecified whether readers or writers have priority in acquiring the
 * lock when a reader already holds the lock and a writer is queued to acquire
 * it.
 *
 * Here is an example for an array with access functions:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GRWLock lock;
 *   GPtrArray *array;
 *
 *   gpointer
 *   my_array_get (guint index)
 *   {
 *     gpointer retval = NULL;
 *
 *     if (!array)
 *       return NULL;
 *
 *     g_rw_lock_reader_lock (&lock);
 *     if (index < array->len)
 *       retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
 *     g_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&lock);
 *
 *     return retval;
 *   }
 *
 *   void
 *   my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
 *   {
 *     g_rw_lock_writer_lock (&lock);
 *
 *     if (!array)
 *       array = g_ptr_array_new ();
 *
 *     if (index >= array->len)
 *       g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index+1);
 *     g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
 *
 *     g_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&lock);
 *   }
 *  ]|
 * This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
 * (the my_array_get() function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
 * (the my_array_set() function) will only be allowed one at a time
 * and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
 * of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
 * functions is fully multi-thread safe now.
 *
 * If a #GRWLock is allocated in static storage then it can be used
 * without initialisation.  Otherwise, you should call
 * g_rw_lock_init() on it and g_rw_lock_clear() when done.
 *
 * A GRWLock should only be accessed with the g_rw_lock_ functions.

/**
 * GUri:
 *
 * A parsed absolute URI.
 *
 * Since #GUri only represents absolute URIs, all #GUris will have a
 * URI scheme, so g_uri_get_scheme() will always return a non-%NULL
 * answer. Likewise, by definition, all URIs have a path component, so
 * g_uri_get_path() will always return non-%NULL (though it may return
 * the empty string).
 *
 * If the URI string has an "authority" component (that is, if the
 * scheme is followed by "`://`" rather than just "`:`"), then the
 * #GUri will contain a hostname, and possibly a port and "userinfo".
 * Additionally, depending on how the #GUri was constructed/parsed,
 * the userinfo may be split out into a username, password, and
 * additional authorization-related parameters.
 *
 * Normally, the components of a #GUri will have all `%`-encoded
 * characters decoded. However, if you construct/parse a #GUri with
 * %G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED, then the `%`-encoding will be preserved instead in
 * the userinfo, path, and query fields (and in the host field if also
 * created with %G_URI_FLAGS_NON_DNS). In particular, this is necessary if
 * the URI may contain binary data or non-UTF-8 text, or if decoding
 * the components might change the interpretation of the URI.
 *
 * For example, with the encoded flag:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GUri *uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue", G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED, &err);
 *   g_assert_cmpstr (g_uri_get_query (uri), ==, "query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue");
 * ]|
 *
 * While the default `%`-decoding behaviour would give:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GUri *uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fparam%3Dvalue", G_URI_FLAGS_NONE, &err);
 *   g_assert_cmpstr (g_uri_get_query (uri), ==, "query=http://host/path?param=value");
 * ]|
 *
 * During decoding, if an invalid UTF-8 string is encountered, parsing will fail
 * with an error indicating the bad string location:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GUri *uri = g_uri_parse ("http://host/path?query=http%3A%2F%2Fhost%2Fpath%3Fbad%3D%00alue", G_URI_FLAGS_NONE, &err);
 *   g_assert_error(err, G_URI_ERROR, G_URI_ERROR_BAD_QUERY);
 * ]|
 *
 * (you should pass %G_URI_FLAGS_ENCODED if you need to handle that case manually).

/**
 * GVariantDict:
 *
 * #GVariantDict is a mutable interface to #GVariant dictionaries.
 *
 * It can be used for doing a sequence of dictionary lookups in an
 * efficient way on an existing #GVariant dictionary or it can be used
 * to construct new dictionaries with a hashtable-like interface.  It
 * can also be used for taking existing dictionaries and modifying them
 * in order to create new ones.
 *
 * #GVariantDict can only be used with %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARDICT
 * dictionaries.
 *
 * It is possible to use #GVariantDict allocated on the stack or on the
 * heap.  When using a stack-allocated #GVariantDict, you begin with a
 * call to g_variant_dict_init() and free the resources with a call to
 * g_variant_dict_clear().
 *
 * Heap-allocated #GVariantDict follows normal refcounting rules: you
 * allocate it with g_variant_dict_new() and use g_variant_dict_ref()
 * and g_variant_dict_unref().
 *
 * g_variant_dict_end() is used to convert the #GVariantDict back into a
 * dictionary-type #GVariant.  When used with stack-allocated instances,
 * this also implicitly frees all associated memory, but for
 * heap-allocated instances, you must still call g_variant_dict_unref()
 * afterwards.
 *
 * You will typically want to use a heap-allocated #GVariantDict when
 * you expose it as part of an API.  For most other uses, the
 * stack-allocated form will be more convenient.
 *
 * Consider the following two examples that do the same thing in each
 * style: take an existing dictionary and look up the "count" uint32
 * key, adding 1 to it if it is found, or returning an error if the
 * key is not found.  Each returns the new dictionary as a floating
 * #GVariant.

/**
 * SECTION:arcbox
 * @Title: Atomically reference counted data
 * @Short_description: Allocated memory with atomic reference counting semantics
 *
 * An "atomically reference counted box", or "ArcBox", is an opaque wrapper
 * data type that is guaranteed to be as big as the size of a given data type,
 * and which augments the given data type with thread safe reference counting
 * semantics for its memory management.
 *
 * ArcBox is useful if you have a plain old data type, like a structure
 * typically placed on the stack, and you wish to provide additional API
 * to use it on the heap; or if you want to implement a new type to be
 * passed around by reference without necessarily implementing copy/free
 * semantics or your own reference counting.
 *
 * The typical use is:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * typedef struct {
 *   char *name;
 *   char *address;
 *   char *city;
 *   char *state;
 *   int age;
 * } Person;
 *
 * Person *
 * person_new (void)
 * {
 *   return g_atomic_rc_box_new0 (Person);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Every time you wish to acquire a reference on the memory, you should
 * call g_atomic_rc_box_acquire(); similarly, when you wish to release a reference
 * you should call g_atomic_rc_box_release():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * // Add a Person to the Database; the Database acquires ownership
 * // of the Person instance
 * void
 * add_person_to_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_prepend (db->persons, g_atomic_rc_box_acquire (p));
 * }
 *
 * // Removes a Person from the Database; the reference acquired by
 * // add_person_to_database() is released here
 * void
 * remove_person_from_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_remove (db->persons, p);
 *   g_atomic_rc_box_release (p);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If you have additional memory allocated inside the structure, you can
 * use g_atomic_rc_box_release_full(), which takes a function pointer, which
 * will be called if the reference released was the last:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * void
 * person_clear (Person *p)
 * {
 *   g_free (p->name);
 *   g_free (p->address);
 *   g_free (p->city);
 *   g_free (p->state);
 * }
 *
 * void
 * remove_person_from_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_remove (db->persons, p);
 *   g_atomic_rc_box_release_full (p, (GDestroyNotify) person_clear);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If you wish to transfer the ownership of a reference counted data
 * type without increasing the reference count, you can use g_steal_pointer():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   Person *p = g_atomic_rc_box_new (Person);
 *
 *   fill_person_details (p);
 *
 *   add_person_to_database (db, g_steal_pointer (&p));
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * The reference counting operations on data allocated using g_atomic_rc_box_alloc(),
 * g_atomic_rc_box_new(), and g_atomic_rc_box_dup() are guaranteed to be atomic, and thus
 * can be safely be performed by different threads. It is important to note that
 * only the reference acquisition and release are atomic; changes to the content
 * of the data are your responsibility.
 *
 * ## Automatic pointer clean up
 *
 * If you want to add g_autoptr() support to your plain old data type through
 * reference counting, you can use the G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC() and
 * g_atomic_rc_box_release():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC (MyDataStruct, g_atomic_rc_box_release)
 * ]|
 *
 * If you need to clear the contents of the data, you will need to use an
 * ancillary function that calls g_rc_box_release_full():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_data_struct_release (MyDataStruct *data)
 * {
 *   // my_data_struct_clear() is defined elsewhere
 *   g_atomic_rc_box_release_full (data, (GDestroyNotify) my_data_struct_clear);

/**
 * SECTION:async_queues
 * @title: Asynchronous Queues
 * @short_description: asynchronous communication between threads
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool
 *
 * Often you need to communicate between different threads. In general
 * it's safer not to do this by shared memory, but by explicit message
 * passing. These messages only make sense asynchronously for
 * multi-threaded applications though, as a synchronous operation could
 * as well be done in the same thread.
 *
 * Asynchronous queues are an exception from most other GLib data
 * structures, as they can be used simultaneously from multiple threads
 * without explicit locking and they bring their own builtin reference
 * counting. This is because the nature of an asynchronous queue is that
 * it will always be used by at least 2 concurrent threads.
 *
 * For using an asynchronous queue you first have to create one with
 * g_async_queue_new(). #GAsyncQueue structs are reference counted,
 * use g_async_queue_ref() and g_async_queue_unref() to manage your
 * references.
 *
 * A thread which wants to send a message to that queue simply calls
 * g_async_queue_push() to push the message to the queue.
 *
 * A thread which is expecting messages from an asynchronous queue
 * simply calls g_async_queue_pop() for that queue. If no message is
 * available in the queue at that point, the thread is now put to sleep
 * until a message arrives. The message will be removed from the queue
 * and returned. The functions g_async_queue_try_pop() and
 * g_async_queue_timeout_pop() can be used to only check for the presence
 * of messages or to only wait a certain time for messages respectively.
 *
 * For almost every function there exist two variants, one that locks
 * the queue and one that doesn't. That way you can hold the queue lock
 * (acquire it with g_async_queue_lock() and release it with
 * g_async_queue_unlock()) over multiple queue accessing instructions.
 * This can be necessary to ensure the integrity of the queue, but should
 * only be used when really necessary, as it can make your life harder
 * if used unwisely. Normally you should only use the locking function
 * variants (those without the _unlocked suffix).
 *
 * In many cases, it may be more convenient to use #GThreadPool when
 * you need to distribute work to a set of worker threads instead of
 * using #GAsyncQueue manually. #GThreadPool uses a GAsyncQueue
 * internally.

/**
 * SECTION:atomic_operations
 * @title: Atomic Operations
 * @short_description: basic atomic integer and pointer operations
 * @see_also: #GMutex
 *
 * The following is a collection of compiler macros to provide atomic
 * access to integer and pointer-sized values.
 *
 * The macros that have 'int' in the name will operate on pointers to
 * #gint and #guint.  The macros with 'pointer' in the name will operate
 * on pointers to any pointer-sized value, including #gsize.  There is
 * no support for 64bit operations on platforms with 32bit pointers
 * because it is not generally possible to perform these operations
 * atomically.
 *
 * The get, set and exchange operations for integers and pointers
 * nominally operate on #gint and #gpointer, respectively.  Of the
 * arithmetic operations, the 'add' operation operates on (and returns)
 * signed integer values (#gint and #gssize) and the 'and', 'or', and
 * 'xor' operations operate on (and return) unsigned integer values
 * (#guint and #gsize).
 *
 * All of the operations act as a full compiler and (where appropriate)
 * hardware memory barrier.  Acquire and release or producer and
 * consumer barrier semantics are not available through this API.
 *
 * It is very important that all accesses to a particular integer or
 * pointer be performed using only this API and that different sizes of
 * operation are not mixed or used on overlapping memory regions.  Never
 * read or assign directly from or to a value -- always use this API.
 *
 * For simple reference counting purposes you should use
 * g_atomic_int_inc() and g_atomic_int_dec_and_test().  Other uses that
 * fall outside of simple reference counting patterns are prone to
 * subtle bugs and occasionally undefined behaviour.  It is also worth
 * noting that since all of these operations require global
 * synchronisation of the entire machine, they can be quite slow.  In
 * the case of performing multiple atomic operations it can often be
 * faster to simply acquire a mutex lock around the critical area,
 * perform the operations normally and then release the lock.

/**
 * SECTION:bookmarkfile
 * @title: Bookmark file parser
 * @short_description: parses files containing bookmarks
 *
 * GBookmarkFile lets you parse, edit or create files containing bookmarks
 * to URI, along with some meta-data about the resource pointed by the URI
 * like its MIME type, the application that is registering the bookmark and
 * the icon that should be used to represent the bookmark. The data is stored
 * using the
 * [Desktop Bookmark Specification](http://www.gnome.org/~ebassi/bookmark-spec).
 *
 * The syntax of the bookmark files is described in detail inside the
 * Desktop Bookmark Specification, here is a quick summary: bookmark
 * files use a sub-class of the XML Bookmark Exchange Language
 * specification, consisting of valid UTF-8 encoded XML, under the
 * <xbel> root element; each bookmark is stored inside a
 * <bookmark> element, using its URI: no relative paths can
 * be used inside a bookmark file. The bookmark may have a user defined
 * title and description, to be used instead of the URI. Under the
 * <metadata> element, with its owner attribute set to
 * `http://freedesktop.org`, is stored the meta-data about a resource
 * pointed by its URI. The meta-data consists of the resource's MIME
 * type; the applications that have registered a bookmark; the groups
 * to which a bookmark belongs to; a visibility flag, used to set the
 * bookmark as "private" to the applications and groups that has it
 * registered; the URI and MIME type of an icon, to be used when
 * displaying the bookmark inside a GUI.
 *
 * Here is an example of a bookmark file:
 * [bookmarks.xbel](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/glib/tests/bookmarks.xbel)
 *
 * A bookmark file might contain more than one bookmark; each bookmark
 * is accessed through its URI.
 *
 * The important caveat of bookmark files is that when you add a new
 * bookmark you must also add the application that is registering it, using
 * g_bookmark_file_add_application() or g_bookmark_file_set_application_info().
 * If a bookmark has no applications then it won't be dumped when creating
 * the on disk representation, using g_bookmark_file_to_data() or
 * g_bookmark_file_to_file().
 *
 * The #GBookmarkFile parser was added in GLib 2.12.

 * SECTION:byte_order
 * @title: Byte Order Macros
 * @short_description: a portable way to convert between different byte orders
 *
 * These macros provide a portable way to determine the host byte order
 * and to convert values between different byte orders.
 *
 * The byte order is the order in which bytes are stored to create larger
 * data types such as the #gint and #glong values.
 * The host byte order is the byte order used on the current machine.
 *
 * Some processors store the most significant bytes (i.e. the bytes that
 * hold the largest part of the value) first. These are known as big-endian
 * processors. Other processors (notably the x86 family) store the most
 * significant byte last. These are known as little-endian processors.
 *
 * Finally, to complicate matters, some other processors store the bytes in
 * a rather curious order known as PDP-endian. For a 4-byte word, the 3rd
 * most significant byte is stored first, then the 4th, then the 1st and
 * finally the 2nd.
 *
 * Obviously there is a problem when these different processors communicate
 * with each other, for example over networks or by using binary file formats.
 * This is where these macros come in. They are typically used to convert
 * values into a byte order which has been agreed on for use when
 * communicating between different processors. The Internet uses what is
 * known as 'network byte order' as the standard byte order (which is in
 * fact the big-endian byte order).
 *
 * Note that the byte order conversion macros may evaluate their arguments
 * multiple times, thus you should not use them with arguments which have
 * side-effects.

 *
 * GLib supports incremental checksums using the GChecksum data

/**
 * SECTION:conversions
 * @title: Character Set Conversion
 * @short_description: convert strings between different character sets
 *
 * The g_convert() family of function wraps the functionality of iconv().
 * In addition to pure character set conversions, GLib has functions to
 * deal with the extra complications of encodings for file names.
 *
 * ## File Name Encodings
 *
 * Historically, UNIX has not had a defined encoding for file names:
 * a file name is valid as long as it does not have path separators
 * in it ("/"). However, displaying file names may require conversion:
 * from the character set in which they were created, to the character
 * set in which the application operates. Consider the Spanish file name
 * "Presentación.sxi". If the application which created it uses
 * ISO-8859-1 for its encoding,
 * |[
 * Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  ó  n  .  s  x  i
 * Hex code:   50 72 65 73 65 6e 74 61 63 69 f3 6e 2e 73 78 69
 * ]|
 * However, if the application use UTF-8, the actual file name on
 * disk would look like this:
 * |[
 * Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  ó     n  .  s  x  i
 * Hex code:   50 72 65 73 65 6e 74 61 63 69 c3 b3 6e 2e 73 78 69
 * ]|
 * Glib uses UTF-8 for its strings, and GUI toolkits like GTK+ that use
 * GLib do the same thing. If you get a file name from the file system,
 * for example, from readdir() or from g_dir_read_name(), and you wish
 * to display the file name to the user, you  will need to convert it
 * into UTF-8. The opposite case is when the user types the name of a
 * file they wish to save: the toolkit will give you that string in
 * UTF-8 encoding, and you will need to convert it to the character
 * set used for file names before you can create the file with open()
 * or fopen().
 *
 * By default, GLib assumes that file names on disk are in UTF-8
 * encoding. This is a valid assumption for file systems which
 * were created relatively recently: most applications use UTF-8
 * encoding for their strings, and that is also what they use for
 * the file names they create. However, older file systems may
 * still contain file names created in "older" encodings, such as
 * ISO-8859-1. In this case, for compatibility reasons, you may want
 * to instruct GLib to use that particular encoding for file names
 * rather than UTF-8. You can do this by specifying the encoding for
 * file names in the [`G_FILENAME_ENCODING`][G_FILENAME_ENCODING]
 * environment variable. For example, if your installation uses
 * ISO-8859-1 for file names, you can put this in your `~/.profile`:
 * |[
 * export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1
 * ]|
 * GLib provides the functions g_filename_to_utf8() and
 * g_filename_from_utf8() to perform the necessary conversions.
 * These functions convert file names from the encoding specified
 * in `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` to UTF-8 and vice-versa. This
 * [diagram][file-name-encodings-diagram] illustrates how
 * these functions are used to convert between UTF-8 and the
 * encoding for file names in the file system.
 *
 * ## Conversion between file name encodings # {#file-name-encodings-diagram)
 *
 * ![](file-name-encodings.png)
 *
 * ## Checklist for Application Writers
 *
 * This section is a practical summary of the detailed
 * things to do to make sure your applications process file
 * name encodings correctly.
 *
 * 1. If you get a file name from the file system from a function
 *    such as readdir() or gtk_file_chooser_get_filename(), you do
 *    not need to do any conversion to pass that file name to
 *    functions like open(), rename(), or fopen() -- those are "raw"
 *    file names which the file system understands.
 *
 * 2. If you need to display a file name, convert it to UTF-8 first
 *    by using g_filename_to_utf8(). If conversion fails, display a
 *    string like "Unknown file name". Do not convert this string back
 *    into the encoding used for file names if you wish to pass it to
 *    the file system; use the original file name instead.
 *
 *    For example, the document window of a word processor could display
 *    "Unknown file name" in its title bar but still let the user save
 *    the file, as it would keep the raw file name internally. This
 *    can happen if the user has not set the `G_FILENAME_ENCODING`
 *    environment variable even though he has files whose names are
 *    not encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * 3. If your user interface lets the user type a file name for saving
 *    or renaming, convert it to the encoding used for file names in
 *    the file system by using g_filename_from_utf8(). Pass the converted
 *    file name to functions like fopen(). If conversion fails, ask the
 *    user to enter a different file name. This can happen if the user
 *    types Japanese characters when `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` is set to
 *    `ISO-8859-1`, for example.

 * There are two forms of most of the dataset functions. The first form
 * uses strings to identify the data elements associated with a

/**
 * SECTION:date
 * @title: Date and Time Functions
 * @short_description: calendrical calculations and miscellaneous time stuff
 *
 * The #GDate data structure represents a day between January 1, Year 1,
 * and sometime a few thousand years in the future (right now it will go
 * to the year 65535 or so, but g_date_set_parse() only parses up to the
 * year 8000 or so - just count on "a few thousand"). #GDate is meant to
 * represent everyday dates, not astronomical dates or historical dates
 * or ISO timestamps or the like. It extrapolates the current Gregorian
 * calendar forward and backward in time; there is no attempt to change
 * the calendar to match time periods or locations. #GDate does not store
 * time information; it represents a day.
 *
 * The #GDate implementation has several nice features; it is only a
 * 64-bit struct, so storing large numbers of dates is very efficient. It
 * can keep both a Julian and day-month-year representation of the date,
 * since some calculations are much easier with one representation or the
 * other. A Julian representation is simply a count of days since some
 * fixed day in the past; for #GDate the fixed day is January 1, 1 AD.
 * ("Julian" dates in the #GDate API aren't really Julian dates in the
 * technical sense; technically, Julian dates count from the start of the
 * Julian period, Jan 1, 4713 BC).
 *
 * #GDate is simple to use. First you need a "blank" date; you can get a
 * dynamically allocated date from g_date_new(), or you can declare an
 * automatic variable or array and initialize it by
 * calling g_date_clear(). A cleared date is safe; it's safe to call
 * g_date_set_dmy() and the other mutator functions to initialize the
 * value of a cleared date. However, a cleared date is initially
 * invalid, meaning that it doesn't represent a day that exists.
 * It is undefined to call any of the date calculation routines on an
 * invalid date. If you obtain a date from a user or other
 * unpredictable source, you should check its validity with the
 * g_date_valid() predicate. g_date_valid() is also used to check for
 * errors with g_date_set_parse() and other functions that can
 * fail. Dates can be invalidated by calling g_date_clear() again.
 *
 * It is very important to use the API to access the #GDate
 * struct. Often only the day-month-year or only the Julian
 * representation is valid. Sometimes neither is valid. Use the API.
 *
 * GLib also features #GDateTime which represents a precise time.

/**
 * SECTION:date-time
 * @title: GDateTime
 * @short_description: a structure representing Date and Time
 * @see_also: #GTimeZone
 *
 * #GDateTime is a structure that combines a Gregorian date and time
 * into a single structure.  It provides many conversion and methods to
 * manipulate dates and times.  Time precision is provided down to
 * microseconds and the time can range (proleptically) from 0001-01-01
 * 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59.999999.  #GDateTime follows POSIX
 * time in the sense that it is oblivious to leap seconds.
 *
 * #GDateTime is an immutable object; once it has been created it cannot
 * be modified further.  All modifiers will create a new #GDateTime.
 * Nearly all such functions can fail due to the date or time going out
 * of range, in which case %NULL will be returned.
 *
 * #GDateTime is reference counted: the reference count is increased by calling
 * g_date_time_ref() and decreased by calling g_date_time_unref(). When the
 * reference count drops to 0, the resources allocated by the #GDateTime
 * structure are released.
 *
 * Many parts of the API may produce non-obvious results.  As an
 * example, adding two months to January 31st will yield March 31st
 * whereas adding one month and then one month again will yield either
 * March 28th or March 29th.  Also note that adding 24 hours is not
 * always the same as adding one day (since days containing daylight
 * savings time transitions are either 23 or 25 hours in length).

 * #GDateTime is available since GLib 2.26.

/**
 * SECTION:error_reporting
 * @Title: Error Reporting
 * @Short_description: a system for reporting errors
 *
 * GLib provides a standard method of reporting errors from a called
 * function to the calling code. (This is the same problem solved by
 * exceptions in other languages.) It's important to understand that
 * this method is both a data type (the #GError struct) and a [set of
 * rules][gerror-rules]. If you use #GError incorrectly, then your code will not
 * properly interoperate with other code that uses #GError, and users
 * of your API will probably get confused. In most cases, [using #GError is
 * preferred over numeric error codes][gerror-comparison], but there are
 * situations where numeric error codes are useful for performance.
 *
 * First and foremost: #GError should only be used to report recoverable
 * runtime errors, never to report programming errors. If the programmer
 * has screwed up, then you should use g_warning(), g_return_if_fail(),
 * g_assert(), g_error(), or some similar facility. (Incidentally,
 * remember that the g_error() function should only be used for
 * programming errors, it should not be used to print any error
 * reportable via #GError.)
 *
 * Examples of recoverable runtime errors are "file not found" or
 * "failed to parse input." Examples of programming errors are "NULL
 * passed to strcmp()" or "attempted to free the same pointer twice."
 * These two kinds of errors are fundamentally different: runtime errors
 * should be handled or reported to the user, programming errors should
 * be eliminated by fixing the bug in the program. This is why most
 * functions in GLib and GTK+ do not use the #GError facility.
 *
 * Functions that can fail take a return location for a #GError as their
 * last argument. On error, a new #GError instance will be allocated and
 * returned to the caller via this argument. For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean g_file_get_contents (const gchar  *filename,
 *                               gchar       **contents,
 *                               gsize        *length,
 *                               GError      **error);
 * ]|
 * If you pass a non-%NULL value for the `error` argument, it should
 * point to a location where an error can be placed. For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gchar *contents;
 * GError *err = NULL;
 *
 * g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", &contents, NULL, &err);
 * g_assert ((contents == NULL && err != NULL) || (contents != NULL && err == NULL));
 * if (err != NULL)
 *   {
 *     // Report error to user, and free error
 *     g_assert (contents == NULL);
 *     fprintf (stderr, "Unable to read file: %s\n", err->message);
 *     g_error_free (err);
 *   }
 * else
 *   {
 *     // Use file contents
 *     g_assert (contents != NULL);
 *   }
 * ]|
 * Note that `err != NULL` in this example is a reliable indicator
 * of whether g_file_get_contents() failed. Additionally,
 * g_file_get_contents() returns a boolean which
 * indicates whether it was successful.
 *
 * Because g_file_get_contents() returns %FALSE on failure, if you
 * are only interested in whether it failed and don't need to display
 * an error message, you can pass %NULL for the @error argument:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * if (g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", &contents, NULL, NULL)) // ignore errors
 *   // no error occurred
 *   ;
 * else
 *   // error
 *   ;
 * ]|
 *
 * The #GError object contains three fields: @domain indicates the module
 * the error-reporting function is located in, @code indicates the specific
 * error that occurred, and @message is a user-readable error message with
 * as many details as possible. Several functions are provided to deal
 * with an error received from a called function: g_error_matches()
 * returns %TRUE if the error matches a given domain and code,
 * g_propagate_error() copies an error into an error location (so the
 * calling function will receive it), and g_clear_error() clears an
 * error location by freeing the error and resetting the location to
 * %NULL. To display an error to the user, simply display the @message,
 * perhaps along with additional context known only to the calling
 * function (the file being opened, or whatever - though in the
 * g_file_get_contents() case, the @message already contains a filename).
 *
 * Note, however, that many error messages are too technical to display to the
 * user in an application, so prefer to use g_error_matches() to categorize errors
 * from called functions, and build an appropriate error message for the context
 * within your application. Error messages from a #GError are more appropriate
 * to be printed in system logs or on the command line. They are typically
 * translated.
 *
 * When implementing a function that can report errors, the basic
 * tool is g_set_error(). Typically, if a fatal error occurs you
 * want to g_set_error(), then return immediately. g_set_error()
 * does nothing if the error location passed to it is %NULL.
 * Here's an example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gint
 * foo_open_file (GError **error)
 * {
 *   gint fd;
 *   int saved_errno;
 *
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (error == NULL || *error == NULL, -1);
 *
 *   fd = open ("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
 *   saved_errno = errno;
 *
 *   if (fd < 0)
 *     {
 *       g_set_error (error,
 *                    FOO_ERROR,                 // error domain
 *                    FOO_ERROR_BLAH,            // error code
 *                    "Failed to open file: %s", // error message format string
 *                    g_strerror (saved_errno));
 *       return -1;
 *     }
 *   else
 *     return fd;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Things are somewhat more complicated if you yourself call another
 * function that can report a #GError. If the sub-function indicates
 * fatal errors in some way other than reporting a #GError, such as
 * by returning %TRUE on success, you can simply do the following:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 *   if (!sub_function_that_can_fail (err))
 *     {
 *       // assert that error was set by the sub-function
 *       g_assert (err == NULL || *err != NULL);
 *       return FALSE;
 *     }
 *
 *   // otherwise continue, no error occurred
 *   g_assert (err == NULL || *err == NULL);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If the sub-function does not indicate errors other than by
 * reporting a #GError (or if its return value does not reliably indicate
 * errors) you need to create a temporary #GError
 * since the passed-in one may be %NULL. g_propagate_error() is
 * intended for use in this case.
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 *   GError *tmp_error;
 *
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 *   tmp_error = NULL;
 *   sub_function_that_can_fail (&tmp_error);
 *
 *   if (tmp_error != NULL)
 *     {
 *       // store tmp_error in err, if err != NULL,
 *       // otherwise call g_error_free() on tmp_error
 *       g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 *       return FALSE;
 *     }
 *
 *   // otherwise continue, no error occurred
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Error pileups are always a bug. For example, this code is incorrect:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 *   GError *tmp_error;
 *
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 *   tmp_error = NULL;
 *   sub_function_that_can_fail (&tmp_error);
 *   other_function_that_can_fail (&tmp_error);
 *
 *   if (tmp_error != NULL)
 *     {
 *       g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 *       return FALSE;
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|
 * @tmp_error should be checked immediately after sub_function_that_can_fail(),
 * and either cleared or propagated upward. The rule is: after each error,
 * you must either handle the error, or return it to the calling function.
 *
 * Note that passing %NULL for the error location is the equivalent
 * of handling an error by always doing nothing about it. So the
 * following code is fine, assuming errors in sub_function_that_can_fail()
 * are not fatal to my_function_that_can_fail():
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 *   GError *tmp_error;
 *
 *   g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 *   sub_function_that_can_fail (NULL); // ignore errors
 *
 *   tmp_error = NULL;
 *   other_function_that_can_fail (&tmp_error);
 *
 *   if (tmp_error != NULL)
 *     {
 *       g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 *       return FALSE;
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that passing %NULL for the error location ignores errors;
 * it's equivalent to
 * `try { sub_function_that_can_fail (); } catch (...) {}`
 * in C++. It does not mean to leave errors unhandled; it means
 * to handle them by doing nothing.
 *
 * Error domains and codes are conventionally named as follows:
 *
 * - The error domain is called <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR,
 *   for example %G_SPAWN_ERROR or %G_THREAD_ERROR:
 *   |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   #define G_SPAWN_ERROR g_spawn_error_quark ()
 *
 *   G_DEFINE_QUARK (g-spawn-error-quark, g_spawn_error)
 *   ]|
 *
 * - The quark function for the error domain is called
 *   <namespace>_<module>_error_quark,
 *   for example g_spawn_error_quark() or g_thread_error_quark().
 *
 * - The error codes are in an enumeration called
 *   <Namespace><Module>Error;
 *   for example, #GThreadError or #GSpawnError.
 *
 * - Members of the error code enumeration are called
 *   <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR_<CODE>,
 *   for example %G_SPAWN_ERROR_FORK or %G_THREAD_ERROR_AGAIN.
 *
 * - If there's a "generic" or "unknown" error code for unrecoverable
 *   errors it doesn't make sense to distinguish with specific codes,
 *   it should be called <NAMESPACE>_<MODULE>_ERROR_FAILED,
 *   for example %G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED. In the case of error code
 *   enumerations that may be extended in future releases, you should
 *   generally not handle this error code explicitly, but should
 *   instead treat any unrecognized error code as equivalent to
 *   FAILED.
 *
 * ## Comparison of #GError and traditional error handling # {#gerror-comparison}
 *
 * #GError has several advantages over traditional numeric error codes:
 * importantly, tools like
 * [gobject-introspection](https://developer.gnome.org/gi/stable/) understand
 * #GErrors and convert them to exceptions in bindings; the message includes
 * more information than just a code; and use of a domain helps prevent
 * misinterpretation of error codes.
 *
 * #GError has disadvantages though: it requires a memory allocation, and
 * formatting the error message string has a performance overhead. This makes it
 * unsuitable for use in retry loops where errors are a common case, rather than
 * being unusual. For example, using %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK means hitting these
 * overheads in the normal control flow. String formatting overhead can be
 * eliminated by using g_set_error_literal() in some cases.
 *
 * These performance issues can be compounded if a function wraps the #GErrors
 * returned by the functions it calls: this multiplies the number of allocations
 * and string formatting operations. This can be partially mitigated by using
 * g_prefix_error().
 *
 * ## Rules for use of #GError # {#gerror-rules}
 *
 * Summary of rules for use of #GError:
 *
 * - Do not report programming errors via #GError.
 *
 * - The last argument of a function that returns an error should
 *   be a location where a #GError can be placed (i.e. "#GError** error").
 *   If #GError is used with varargs, the #GError** should be the last
 *   argument before the "...".
 *
 * - The caller may pass %NULL for the #GError** if they are not interested
 *   in details of the exact error that occurred.
 *
 * - If %NULL is passed for the #GError** argument, then errors should
 *   not be returned to the caller, but your function should still
 *   abort and return if an error occurs. That is, control flow should
 *   not be affected by whether the caller wants to get a #GError.
 *
 * - If a #GError is reported, then your function by definition had a
 *   fatal failure and did not complete whatever it was supposed to do.
 *   If the failure was not fatal, then you handled it and you should not
 *   report it. If it was fatal, then you must report it and discontinue
 *   whatever you were doing immediately.
 *
 * - If a #GError is reported, out parameters are not guaranteed to
 *   be set to any defined value.
 *
 * - A #GError* must be initialized to %NULL before passing its address
 *   to a function that can report errors.
 *
 * - "Piling up" errors is always a bug. That is, if you assign a
 *   new #GError to a #GError* that is non-%NULL, thus overwriting
 *   the previous error, it indicates that you should have aborted
 *   the operation instead of continuing. If you were able to continue,
 *   you should have cleared the previous error with g_clear_error().
 *   g_set_error() will complain if you pile up errors.
 *
 * - By convention, if you return a boolean value indicating success
 *   then %TRUE means success and %FALSE means failure. Avoid creating
 *   functions which have a boolean return value and a GError parameter,
 *   but where the boolean does something other than signal whether the
 *   GError is set.  Among other problems, it requires C callers to allocate
 *   a temporary error.  Instead, provide a "gboolean *" out parameter.
 *   There are functions in GLib itself such as g_key_file_has_key() that
 *   are deprecated because of this. If %FALSE is returned, the error must
 *   be set to a non-%NULL value.  One exception to this is that in situations
 *   that are already considered to be undefined behaviour (such as when a
 *   g_return_val_if_fail() check fails), the error need not be set.
 *   Instead of checking separately whether the error is set, callers
 *   should ensure that they do not provoke undefined behaviour, then
 *   assume that the error will be set on failure.
 *
 * - A %NULL return value is also frequently used to mean that an error
 *   occurred. You should make clear in your documentation whether %NULL
 *   is a valid return value in non-error cases; if %NULL is a valid value,
 *   then users must check whether an error was returned to see if the
 *   function succeeded.
 *
 * - When implementing a function that can report errors, you may want
 *   to add a check at the top of your function that the error return
 *   location is either %NULL or contains a %NULL error (e.g.
 *   `g_return_if_fail (error == NULL || *error == NULL);`).

 *
 * Do not use these APIs unless you are porting a POSIX application to Windows.
 * A more high-level file access API is provided as GIO — see the documentation

 *
 * There is a group of functions which wrap the common POSIX functions
 * dealing with filenames (g_open(), g_rename(), g_mkdir(), g_stat(),
 * g_unlink(), g_remove(), g_fopen(), g_freopen()). The point of these
 * wrappers is to make it possible to handle file names with any Unicode
 * characters in them on Windows without having to use ifdefs and the
 * wide character API in the application code.
 *
 * On some Unix systems, these APIs may be defined as identical to their POSIX
 * counterparts. For this reason, you must check for and include the necessary
 * header files (such as `fcntl.h`) before using functions like g_creat(). You
 * must also define the relevant feature test macros.
 *
 * The pathname argument should be in the GLib file name encoding.
 * On POSIX this is the actual on-disk encoding which might correspond
 * to the locale settings of the process (or the `G_FILENAME_ENCODING`
 * environment variable), or not.
 *
 * On Windows the GLib file name encoding is UTF-8. Note that the
 * Microsoft C library does not use UTF-8, but has separate APIs for
 * current system code page and wide characters (UTF-16). The GLib
 * wrappers call the wide character API if present (on modern Windows
 * systems), otherwise convert to/from the system code page.
 *
 * Another group of functions allows to open and read directories

/**
 * SECTION:gregex
 * @title: Perl-compatible regular expressions
 * @short_description: matches strings against regular expressions
 * @see_also: [Regular expression syntax][glib-regex-syntax]
 *
 * The g_regex_*() functions implement regular
 * expression pattern matching using syntax and semantics similar to
 * Perl regular expression.
 *
 * Some functions accept a @start_position argument, setting it differs
 * from just passing over a shortened string and setting #G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL
 * in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion.
 * For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
 * in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
 * subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
 * from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
 * always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
 * boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
 * @start_position set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because
 * it is able to look behind the starting point to discover that it is
 * preceded by a letter.
 *
 * Note that, unless you set the #G_REGEX_RAW flag, all the strings passed
 * to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
 * inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
 * "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "à") is two bytes long but it is treated as a
 * single character. If you set #G_REGEX_RAW the strings can be non-valid
 * UTF-8 strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two
 * bytes and two characters long.
 *
 * When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in
 * the string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline
 * sequence use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character
 * sequence CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed,
 * U+000A, "\n"), VT vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"),
 * CR (carriage return, U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
 * separator, U+2028), or PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
 *
 * The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are
 * affected by newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline
 * character (the same characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed
 * with #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR, #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF and #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF
 * compile options, and with #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY,
 * #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR, #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_LF and
 * #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CRLF match options. These settings are also
 * relevant when compiling a pattern if #G_REGEX_EXTENDED is set, and an
 * unescaped "#" outside a character class is encountered. This indicates
 * a comment that lasts until after the next newline.
 *
 * When setting the %G_REGEX_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT flag, pattern syntax and pattern
 * matching is changed to be compatible with the way that regular expressions
 * work in JavaScript. More precisely, a lonely ']' character in the pattern
 * is a syntax error; the '\x' escape only allows 0 to 2 hexadecimal digits, and
 * you must use the '\u' escape sequence with 4 hex digits to specify a unicode
 * codepoint instead of '\x' or 'x{....}'. If '\x' or '\u' are not followed by
 * the specified number of hex digits, they match 'x' and 'u' literally; also
 * '\U' always matches 'U' instead of being an error in the pattern. Finally,
 * pattern matching is modified so that back references to an unset subpattern
 * group produces a match with the empty string instead of an error. See
 * pcreapi(3) for more information.
 *
 * Creating and manipulating the same #GRegex structure from different
 * threads is not a problem as #GRegex does not modify its internal
 * state between creation and destruction, on the other hand #GMatchInfo
 * is not threadsafe.
 *
 * The regular expressions low-level functionalities are obtained through
 * the excellent
 * [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/)
 * library written by Philip Hazel.

/**
 * SECTION:guri
 * @short_description: URI-handling utilities
 * @include: glib.h
 *
 * The #GUri type and related functions can be used to parse URIs into
 * their components, and build valid URIs from individual components.
 *
 * ## Parsing URIs
 *
 * The most minimalist APIs for parsing URIs are g_uri_split() and
 * g_uri_split_with_user(). These split a URI into its component
 * parts, and return the parts; the difference between the two is that
 * g_uri_split() treats the "userinfo" component of the URI as a
 * single element, while g_uri_split_with_user() can (depending on the
 * #GUriFlags you pass) treat it as containing a username, password,
 * and authentication parameters. Alternatively, g_uri_split_network()
 * can be used when you are only interested in the components that are
 * needed to initiate a network connection to the service (scheme,
 * host, and port).
 *
 * g_uri_parse() is similar to g_uri_split(), but instead of returning
 * individual strings, it returns a #GUri structure (and it requires
 * that the URI be an absolute URI).
 *
 * g_uri_resolve_relative() and g_uri_parse_relative() allow you to
 * resolve a relative URI relative to a base URI.
 * g_uri_resolve_relative() takes two strings and returns a string,
 * and g_uri_parse_relative() takes a #GUri and a string and returns a
 * #GUri.
 *
 * All of the parsing functions take a #GUriFlags argument describing
 * exactly how to parse the URI; see the documentation for that type
 * for more details on the specific flags that you can pass. If you
 * need to choose different flags based on the type of URI, you can
 * use g_uri_peek_scheme() on the URI string to check the scheme
 * first, and use that to decide what flags to parse it with.
 *
 * ## Building URIs
 *
 * g_uri_join() and g_uri_join_with_user() can be used to construct
 * valid URI strings from a set of component strings; they are the
 * inverse of g_uri_split() and g_uri_split_with_user().
 *
 * Similarly, g_uri_build() and g_uri_build_with_user() can be used to
 * construct a #GUri from a set of component strings.
 *
 * As with the parsing functions, the building functions take a
 * #GUriFlags argument; in particular, it is important to keep in mind
 * whether the URI components you are using have `%`-encoded
 * characters in them or not, and pass the appropriate flags
 * accordingly.
 *
 * ## `file://` URIs
 *
 * Note that Windows and Unix both define special rules for parsing
 * `file://` URIs (involving non-UTF-8 character sets on Unix, and the
 * interpretation of path separators on Windows). #GUri does not
 * implement these rules. Use g_filename_from_uri() and
 * g_filename_to_uri() if you want to properly convert between
 * `file://` URIs and local filenames.
 *
 * ## URI Equality
 *
 * Note that there is no `g_uri_equal ()` function, because comparing
 * URIs usefully requires scheme-specific knowledge that #GUri does
 * not have. For example, "`http://example.com/`" and
 * "`http://EXAMPLE.COM:80`" have exactly the same meaning according
 * to the HTTP specification, and "`data:,foo`" and
 * "`data:;base64,Zm9v`" resolve to the same thing according to the
 * `data:` URI specification.

/**
 * SECTION:gvariant
 * @title: GVariant
 * @short_description: strongly typed value datatype
 * @see_also: GVariantType
 *
 * #GVariant is a variant datatype; it can contain one or more values
 * along with information about the type of the values.
 *
 * A #GVariant may contain simple types, like an integer, or a boolean value;
 * or complex types, like an array of two strings, or a dictionary of key
 * value pairs. A #GVariant is also immutable: once it's been created neither
 * its type nor its content can be modified further.
 *
 * GVariant is useful whenever data needs to be serialized, for example when
 * sending method parameters in DBus, or when saving settings using GSettings.
 *
 * When creating a new #GVariant, you pass the data you want to store in it
 * along with a string representing the type of data you wish to pass to it.
 *
 * For instance, if you want to create a #GVariant holding an integer value you
 * can use:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GVariant *v = g_variant_new ("u", 40);
 * ]|
 *
 * The string "u" in the first argument tells #GVariant that the data passed to
 * the constructor (40) is going to be an unsigned integer.
 *
 * More advanced examples of #GVariant in use can be found in documentation for
 * [GVariant format strings][gvariant-format-strings-pointers].
 *
 * The range of possible values is determined by the type.
 *
 * The type system used by #GVariant is #GVariantType.
 *
 * #GVariant instances always have a type and a value (which are given
 * at construction time).  The type and value of a #GVariant instance
 * can never change other than by the #GVariant itself being
 * destroyed.  A #GVariant cannot contain a pointer.
 *
 * #GVariant is reference counted using g_variant_ref() and
 * g_variant_unref().  #GVariant also has floating reference counts --
 * see g_variant_ref_sink().
 *
 * #GVariant is completely threadsafe.  A #GVariant instance can be
 * concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
 * problems.
 *
 * #GVariant is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialised
 * form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
 * files.  It can perform nearly all deserialisation operations in a
 * small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
 * Serialised #GVariant data can also be sent over the network.
 *
 * #GVariant is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
 * #GVariant instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See #GVariantType for
 * exceptions.  (However, #GVariant's serialisation format is not the same
 * as the serialisation format of a D-Bus message body: use #GDBusMessage,
 * in the gio library, for those.)
 *
 * For space-efficiency, the #GVariant serialisation format does not
 * automatically include the variant's length, type or endianness,
 * which must either be implied from context (such as knowledge that a
 * particular file format always contains a little-endian
 * %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT which occupies the whole length of the file)
 * or supplied out-of-band (for instance, a length, type and/or endianness
 * indicator could be placed at the beginning of a file, network message
 * or network stream).
 *
 * A #GVariant's size is limited mainly by any lower level operating
 * system constraints, such as the number of bits in #gsize.  For
 * example, it is reasonable to have a 2GB file mapped into memory
 * with #GMappedFile, and call g_variant_new_from_data() on it.
 *
 * For convenience to C programmers, #GVariant features powerful
 * varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is
 * designed to be embedded in other libraries.
 *
 * There is a Python-inspired text language for describing #GVariant
 * values.  #GVariant includes a printer for this language and a parser
 * with type inferencing.
 *
 * ## Memory Use
 *
 * #GVariant tries to be quite efficient with respect to memory use.
 * This section gives a rough idea of how much memory is used by the
 * current implementation.  The information here is subject to change
 * in the future.
 *
 * The memory allocated by #GVariant can be grouped into 4 broad
 * purposes: memory for serialised data, memory for the type
 * information cache, buffer management memory and memory for the
 * #GVariant structure itself.
 *
 * ## Serialised Data Memory
 *
 * This is the memory that is used for storing GVariant data in
 * serialised form.  This is what would be sent over the network or
 * what would end up on disk, not counting any indicator of the
 * endianness, or of the length or type of the top-level variant.
 *
 * The amount of memory required to store a boolean is 1 byte. 16,
 * 32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
 * use their "natural" size.  Strings (including object path and
 * signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
 * use the length of the string plus 1 byte.
 *
 * Maybe types use no space at all to represent the null value and
 * use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
 * equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.
 *
 * Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
 * members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
 * array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
 * then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
 * size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
 * overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
 * are added as required for alignment of child values.
 *
 * Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
 * required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
 * framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
 * the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
 * bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.
 *
 * Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
 * variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
 * item inside the variant.
 *
 * As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
 * In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
 * the serialisation.
 *
 * If we add an item "width" that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
 * we will use 4 byte to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
 * containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
 * aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that's 2 extra
 * bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
 * for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
 * array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.
 *
 * If we add another entry, "title" that maps to a nullable string
 * that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
 * null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
 * its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
 * padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.
 *
 * We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
 * After the 14 bytes of the first item, that's 2 bytes required.
 * We now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two
 * bytes. 14 + 2 + 11 + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item
 * dictionary.
 *
 * ## Type Information Cache
 *
 * For each GVariant type that currently exists in the program a type
 * information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
 * type information structure is required for rapid deserialisation.
 *
 * Continuing with the above example, if a #GVariant exists with the
 * type "a{sv}" then a type information struct will exist for
 * "a{sv}", "{sv}", "s", and "v".  Multiple uses of the same type
 * will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
 * single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
 * not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
 * #GVariant.
 *
 * Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
 * memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
 * container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
 * maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
 * are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.
 *
 * Array type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus the
 * memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
 * on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for "a{sv}" would require 30
 * bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 *
 * Tuple type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus 4 *
 * sizeof (void *) for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
 * required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
 * example, would have a type information structure that consumed
 * writable memory in the size of 14 * sizeof (void *) (plus type
 * string)  This means that on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for
 * "{sv}" would require 61 bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 *
 * This means that in total, for our "a{sv}" example, 91 bytes of
 * type information would be allocated.
 *
 * The type information cache, additionally, uses a #GHashTable to
 * store and look up the cached items and stores a pointer to this
 * hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
 * are zero items in the type cache.
 *
 * Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
 * that a program will probably only have a very small number of
 * different types of values in it and that only one type information
 * structure is required for many different values of the same type.
 *
 * ## Buffer Management Memory
 *
 * #GVariant uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
 * with the various different possible sources of serialised data
 * that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
 * correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
 * #GVariant.  This may involve a g_free() or a g_slice_free() or
 * even g_mapped_file_unref().
 *
 * One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
 * serialised data.  The size of the buffer management structure
 * is 4 * (void *).  On 32-bit systems, that's 16 bytes.
 *
 * ## GVariant structure
 *
 * The size of a #GVariant structure is 6 * (void *).  On 32-bit
 * systems, that's 24 bytes.
 *
 * #GVariant structures only exist if they are explicitly created
 * with API calls.  For example, if a #GVariant is constructed out of
 * serialised data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
 * then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
 * entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
 * the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
 * only 1 #GVariant instance exists -- the one referring to the
 * dictionary.
 *
 * If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
 * #GVariant instances will exist for those values only for as long
 * as they are in use (ie: until you call g_variant_unref()).  The
 * type information is shared.  The serialised data and the buffer
 * management structure for that serialised data is shared by the
 * child.
 *
 * ## Summary
 *
 * To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
 * strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
 * using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 bytes of memory
 * for the serialised data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
 * bytes for the #GVariant instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
 * malloc overhead.  If we were to use g_variant_get_child_value() to
 * access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
 * bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
 * would use more memory for the serialised data and buffer
 * management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
 * be shared.

/**
 * SECTION:gvarianttype
 * @title: GVariantType
 * @short_description: introduction to the GVariant type system
 * @see_also: #GVariantType, #GVariant
 *
 * This section introduces the GVariant type system. It is based, in
 * large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
 * some minor lifting of restrictions. The
 * [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
 * therefore, provides a significant amount of
 * information that is useful when working with GVariant.
 *
 * The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
 * introduction of maybe (or "nullable") types.  Any type in GVariant can be
 * converted to a maybe type, in which case, "nothing" (or "null") becomes a
 * valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
 * character "m" to type strings.
 *
 * The second major change is that the GVariant type system supports the
 * concept of "indefinite types" -- types that are less specific than
 * the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
 * of "an array of any type" in GVariant, where the D-Bus type system
 * would require you to speak of "an array of integers" or "an array of
 * strings".  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
 * characters "*", "?" and "r" to type strings.
 *
 * Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
 * types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
 * may only appear nested inside of arrays.
 *
 * Just as in D-Bus, GVariant types are described with strings ("type
 * strings").  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
 * are of the same form as those found in DBus.  Note, however: D-Bus
 * always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
 * strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, "signatures"
 * are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
 * message.  GVariant deals with single values directly so GVariant type
 * strings always describe the type of exactly one value.  This means
 * that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid GVariant type
 * string -- except in the case that it is the signature of a message
 * containing exactly one argument.
 *
 * An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
 * abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
 * indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
 * that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
 * g_variant_get_type() will never return an indefinite type, but
 * calling g_variant_is_of_type() with an indefinite type may return
 * %TRUE.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents "an
 * array of no particular type", but you can have an "array of integers"
 * which certainly matches the type of "an array of no particular type",
 * since "array of integers" is a subtype of "array of no particular
 * type".
 *
 * This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
 * directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
 * non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
 * the type of #GtkBin can exist (since #GtkBin is an abstract class),
 * but a #GtkWindow can certainly be instantiated, and you would say
 * that the #GtkWindow is a #GtkBin (since #GtkWindow is a subclass of
 * #GtkBin).
 *
 * ## GVariant Type Strings
 *
 * A GVariant type string can be any of the following:
 *
 * - any basic type string (listed below)
 *
 * - "v", "r" or "*"
 *
 * - one of the characters 'a' or 'm', followed by another type string
 *
 * - the character '(', followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
 *   type strings, followed by the character ')'
 *
 * - the character '{', followed by a basic type string (see below),
 *   followed by another type string, followed by the character '}'
 *
 * A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
 * g_variant_type_is_basic()) and is always a single character in length.
 * The valid basic type strings are "b", "y", "n", "q", "i", "u", "x", "t",
 * "h", "d", "s", "o", "g" and "?".
 *
 * The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. "aaaaai" and
 * "(ui(nq((y)))s)" are both valid type strings, as is
 * "a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))". In order to not hit memory limits, #GVariant
 * imposes a limit on recursion depth of 65 nested containers. This is the
 * limit in the D-Bus specification (64) plus one to allow a #GDBusMessage to
 * be nested in a top-level tuple.
 *
 * The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:
 * - `b`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN; a boolean value.
 * - `y`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE; a byte.
 * - `n`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16; a signed 16 bit integer.
 * - `q`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
 * - `i`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32; a signed 32 bit integer.
 * - `u`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
 * - `x`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64; a signed 64 bit integer.
 * - `t`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
 * - `h`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE; a signed 32 bit value
 *   that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
 *   descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
 * - `d`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE; a double precision
 *   floating point value.
 * - `s`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING; a string.
 * - `o`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH; a string in the form
 *   of a D-Bus object path.
 * - `g`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE; a string in the form of
 *   a D-Bus type signature.
 * - `?`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC; an indefinite type that
 *   is a supertype of any of the basic types.
 * - `v`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT; a container type that
 *   contain any other type of value.
 * - `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
 *   type; the type string "ai", for example, is the type of an array of
 *   signed 32-bit integers.
 * - `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a "maybe", or
 *   "nullable", version of that type; the type string "ms", for example,
 *   is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
 *   nothing.
 * - `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
 *   create a tuple type; the type string "(is)", for example, is the type of
 *   a pair of an integer and a string.
 * - `r`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE; an indefinite type that is
 *   a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
 * - `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
 *   string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
 *   an array to form a dictionary; the type string "a{sd}", for example, is
 *   the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
 *   point values.
 *
 *   The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
 *   the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
 *   basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
 * - `*`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY; the indefinite type that is
 *   a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
 *   character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
 *   to mean "any number of items".
 *
 * Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
 * itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string "a*"
 * (corresponding to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY) is an indefinite type
 * that is a supertype of every array type. "(*s)" is a supertype
 * of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
 * item is a string.
 *
 * "a{?*}" is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
 * containing dictionary entries where the key is any basic type and
 * the value is any type at all.  This is, by definition, a dictionary,
 * so this type string corresponds to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DICTIONARY. Note
 * that, due to the restriction that the key of a dictionary entry must
 * be a basic type, "{**}" is not a valid type string.

/**
 * SECTION:hash_tables
 * @title: Hash Tables
 * @short_description: associations between keys and values so that
 *     given a key the value can be found quickly
 *
 * A #GHashTable provides associations between keys and values which is
 * optimized so that given a key, the associated value can be found
 * very quickly.
 *
 * Note that neither keys nor values are copied when inserted into the
 * #GHashTable, so they must exist for the lifetime of the #GHashTable.
 * This means that the use of static strings is OK, but temporary
 * strings (i.e. those created in buffers and those returned by GTK+
 * widgets) should be copied with g_strdup() before being inserted.
 *
 * If keys or values are dynamically allocated, you must be careful to
 * ensure that they are freed when they are removed from the
 * #GHashTable, and also when they are overwritten by new insertions
 * into the #GHashTable. It is also not advisable to mix static strings
 * and dynamically-allocated strings in a #GHashTable, because it then
 * becomes difficult to determine whether the string should be freed.
 *
 * To create a #GHashTable, use g_hash_table_new().
 *
 * To insert a key and value into a #GHashTable, use
 * g_hash_table_insert().
 *
 * To look up a value corresponding to a given key, use
 * g_hash_table_lookup() and g_hash_table_lookup_extended().
 *
 * g_hash_table_lookup_extended() can also be used to simply
 * check if a key is present in the hash table.
 *
 * To remove a key and value, use g_hash_table_remove().
 *
 * To call a function for each key and value pair use
 * g_hash_table_foreach() or use an iterator to iterate over the
 * key/value pairs in the hash table, see #GHashTableIter. The iteration order
 * of a hash table is not defined, and you must not rely on iterating over
 * keys/values in the same order as they were inserted.
 *
 * To destroy a #GHashTable use g_hash_table_destroy().
 *
 * A common use-case for hash tables is to store information about a
 * set of keys, without associating any particular value with each
 * key. GHashTable optimizes one way of doing so: If you store only
 * key-value pairs where key == value, then GHashTable does not
 * allocate memory to store the values, which can be a considerable
 * space saving, if your set is large. The functions
 * g_hash_table_add() and g_hash_table_contains() are designed to be
 * used when using #GHashTable this way.
 *
 * #GHashTable is not designed to be statically initialised with keys and
 * values known at compile time. To build a static hash table, use a tool such
 * as [gperf](https://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/).

 *
 * GLib doesn't force any particular localization method upon its users.
 * But since GLib itself is localized using the gettext() mechanism, it seems
 * natural to offer the de-facto standard gettext() support macros in an
 * easy-to-use form.
 *
 * In order to use these macros in an application, you must include
 * `<glib/gi18n.h>`. For use in a library, you must include
 * `<glib/gi18n-lib.h>`
 * after defining the %GETTEXT_PACKAGE macro suitably for your library:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * #define GETTEXT_PACKAGE "gtk20"
 * #include <glib/gi18n-lib.h>
 * ]|
 * For an application, note that you also have to call bindtextdomain(),
 * bind_textdomain_codeset(), textdomain() and setlocale() early on in your
 * main() to make gettext() work. For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * #include <glib/gi18n.h>
 * #include <locale.h>
 *
 * int
 * main (int argc, char **argv)
 * {
 *   setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
 *   bindtextdomain (GETTEXT_PACKAGE, DATADIR "/locale");
 *   bind_textdomain_codeset (GETTEXT_PACKAGE, "UTF-8");
 *   textdomain (GETTEXT_PACKAGE);
 *
 *   // Rest of your application.
 * }
 * ]|
 * where `DATADIR` is as typically provided by automake or Meson.
 *
 * For a library, you only have to call bindtextdomain() and
 * bind_textdomain_codeset() in your initialization function. If your library
 * doesn't have an initialization function, you can call the functions before
 * the first translated message.
 *
 * The
 * [gettext manual](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Maintainers)

 *
 * The #GIOChannel data type aims to provide a portable method for
 * using file descriptors, pipes, and sockets, and integrating them
 * into the [main event loop][glib-The-Main-Event-Loop]. Currently,
 * full support is available on UNIX platforms, support for Windows
 * is only partially complete.
 *
 * To create a new #GIOChannel on UNIX systems use
 * g_io_channel_unix_new(). This works for plain file descriptors,
 * pipes and sockets. Alternatively, a channel can be created for a
 * file in a system independent manner using g_io_channel_new_file().
 *
 * Once a #GIOChannel has been created, it can be used in a generic
 * manner with the functions g_io_channel_read_chars(),
 * g_io_channel_write_chars(), g_io_channel_seek_position(), and
 * g_io_channel_shutdown().
 *
 * To add a #GIOChannel to the [main event loop][glib-The-Main-Event-Loop],
 * use g_io_add_watch() or g_io_add_watch_full(). Here you specify which
 * events you are interested in on the #GIOChannel, and provide a
 * function to be called whenever these events occur.
 *
 * #GIOChannel instances are created with an initial reference count of 1.
 * g_io_channel_ref() and g_io_channel_unref() can be used to
 * increment or decrement the reference count respectively. When the
 * reference count falls to 0, the #GIOChannel is freed. (Though it
 * isn't closed automatically, unless it was created using
 * g_io_channel_new_file().) Using g_io_add_watch() or
 * g_io_add_watch_full() increments a channel's reference count.
 *
 * The new functions g_io_channel_read_chars(),
 * g_io_channel_read_line(), g_io_channel_read_line_string(),

/**
 * SECTION:keyfile
 * @title: Key-value file parser
 * @short_description: parses .ini-like config files
 *
 * #GKeyFile lets you parse, edit or create files containing groups of
 * key-value pairs, which we call "key files" for lack of a better name.
 * Several freedesktop.org specifications use key files now, e.g the
 * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec)
 * and the
 * [Icon Theme Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec).
 *
 * The syntax of key files is described in detail in the
 * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
 * here is a quick summary: Key files
 * consists of groups of key-value pairs, interspersed with comments.
 *
 * |[
 * # this is just an example
 * # there can be comments before the first group
 *
 * [First Group]
 *
 * Name=Key File Example\tthis value shows\nescaping
 *
 * # localized strings are stored in multiple key-value pairs
 * Welcome=Hello
 * Welcome[de]=Hallo
 * Welcome[fr_FR]=Bonjour
 * Welcome[it]=Ciao
 * Welcome[be@latin]=Hello
 *
 * [Another Group]
 *
 * Numbers=2;20;-200;0
 *
 * Booleans=true;false;true;true
 * ]|
 *
 * Lines beginning with a '#' and blank lines are considered comments.
 *
 * Groups are started by a header line containing the group name enclosed
 * in '[' and ']', and ended implicitly by the start of the next group or
 * the end of the file. Each key-value pair must be contained in a group.
 *
 * Key-value pairs generally have the form `key=value`, with the
 * exception of localized strings, which have the form
 * `key[locale]=value`, with a locale identifier of the
 * form `lang_COUNTRY@MODIFIER` where `COUNTRY` and `MODIFIER`
 * are optional.
 * Space before and after the '=' character are ignored. Newline, tab,
 * carriage return and backslash characters in value are escaped as \n,
 * \t, \r, and \\\\, respectively. To preserve leading spaces in values,
 * these can also be escaped as \s.
 *
 * Key files can store strings (possibly with localized variants), integers,
 * booleans and lists of these. Lists are separated by a separator character,
 * typically ';' or ','. To use the list separator character in a value in
 * a list, it has to be escaped by prefixing it with a backslash.
 *
 * This syntax is obviously inspired by the .ini files commonly met
 * on Windows, but there are some important differences:
 *
 * - .ini files use the ';' character to begin comments,
 *   key files use the '#' character.
 *
 * - Key files do not allow for ungrouped keys meaning only
 *   comments can precede the first group.
 *
 * - Key files are always encoded in UTF-8.
 *
 * - Key and Group names are case-sensitive. For example, a group called
 *   [GROUP] is a different from [group].
 *
 * - .ini files don't have a strongly typed boolean entry type,
 *    they only have GetProfileInt(). In key files, only
 *    true and false (in lower case) are allowed.
 *
 * Note that in contrast to the
 * [Desktop Entry Specification](http://freedesktop.org/Standards/desktop-entry-spec),
 * groups in key files may contain the same
 * key multiple times; the last entry wins. Key files may also contain
 * multiple groups with the same name; they are merged together.
 * Another difference is that keys and group names in key files are not
 * restricted to ASCII characters.
 *
 * Here is an example of loading a key file and reading a value:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
 * g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
 *
 * if (!g_key_file_load_from_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", flags, &error))
 *   {
 *     if (!g_error_matches (error, G_FILE_ERROR, G_FILE_ERROR_NOENT))
 *       g_warning ("Error loading key file: %s", error->message);
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 * g_autofree gchar *val = g_key_file_get_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", &error);
 * if (val == NULL &&
 *     !g_error_matches (error, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR, G_KEY_FILE_ERROR_KEY_NOT_FOUND))
 *   {
 *     g_warning ("Error finding key in key file: %s", error->message);
 *     return;
 *   }
 * else if (val == NULL)
 *   {
 *     // Fall back to a default value.
 *     val = g_strdup ("default-value");
 *   }
 * ]|
 *
 * Here is an example of creating and saving a key file:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * g_autoptr(GKeyFile) key_file = g_key_file_new ();
 * const gchar *val = …;
 * g_autoptr(GError) error = NULL;
 *
 * g_key_file_set_string (key_file, "Group Name", "SomeKey", val);
 *
 * // Save as a file.
 * if (!g_key_file_save_to_file (key_file, "key-file.ini", &error))
 *   {
 *     g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);
 *     return;
 *   }
 *
 * // Or store to a GBytes for use elsewhere.
 * gsize data_len;
 * g_autofree guint8 *data = (guint8 *) g_key_file_to_data (key_file, &data_len, &error);
 * if (data == NULL)
 *   {
 *     g_warning ("Error saving key file: %s", error->message);

/**
 * SECTION:main
 * @title: The Main Event Loop
 * @short_description: manages all available sources of events
 *
 * The main event loop manages all the available sources of events for
 * GLib and GTK+ applications. These events can come from any number of
 * different types of sources such as file descriptors (plain files,
 * pipes or sockets) and timeouts. New types of event sources can also
 * be added using g_source_attach().
 *
 * To allow multiple independent sets of sources to be handled in
 * different threads, each source is associated with a #GMainContext.
 * A #GMainContext can only be running in a single thread, but
 * sources can be added to it and removed from it from other threads. All
 * functions which operate on a #GMainContext or a built-in #GSource are
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * Each event source is assigned a priority. The default priority,
 * #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, is 0. Values less than 0 denote higher priorities.
 * Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities. Events from high priority
 * sources are always processed before events from lower priority sources.
 *
 * Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will
 * be run whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be processed.
 *
 * The #GMainLoop data type represents a main event loop. A GMainLoop is
 * created with g_main_loop_new(). After adding the initial event sources,
 * g_main_loop_run() is called. This continuously checks for new events from
 * each of the event sources and dispatches them. Finally, the processing of
 * an event from one of the sources leads to a call to g_main_loop_quit() to
 * exit the main loop, and g_main_loop_run() returns.
 *
 * It is possible to create new instances of #GMainLoop recursively.
 * This is often used in GTK+ applications when showing modal dialog
 * boxes. Note that event sources are associated with a particular
 * #GMainContext, and will be checked and dispatched for all main
 * loops associated with that GMainContext.
 *
 * GTK+ contains wrappers of some of these functions, e.g. gtk_main(),
 * gtk_main_quit() and gtk_events_pending().
 *
 * ## Creating new source types
 *
 * One of the unusual features of the #GMainLoop functionality
 * is that new types of event source can be created and used in
 * addition to the builtin type of event source. A new event source
 * type is used for handling GDK events. A new source type is created
 * by "deriving" from the #GSource structure. The derived type of
 * source is represented by a structure that has the #GSource structure
 * as a first element, and other elements specific to the new source
 * type. To create an instance of the new source type, call
 * g_source_new() passing in the size of the derived structure and
 * a table of functions. These #GSourceFuncs determine the behavior of
 * the new source type.
 *
 * New source types basically interact with the main context
 * in two ways. Their prepare function in #GSourceFuncs can set a timeout
 * to determine the maximum amount of time that the main loop will sleep
 * before checking the source again. In addition, or as well, the source
 * can add file descriptors to the set that the main context checks using
 * g_source_add_poll().
 *
 * ## Customizing the main loop iteration
 *
 * Single iterations of a #GMainContext can be run with
 * g_main_context_iteration(). In some cases, more detailed control
 * of exactly how the details of the main loop work is desired, for
 * instance, when integrating the #GMainLoop with an external main loop.
 * In such cases, you can call the component functions of
 * g_main_context_iteration() directly. These functions are
 * g_main_context_prepare(), g_main_context_query(),
 * g_main_context_check() and g_main_context_dispatch().
 *
 * ## State of a Main Context # {#mainloop-states}
 *
 * The operation of these functions can best be seen in terms
 * of a state diagram, as shown in this image.
 *
 * ![](mainloop-states.gif)
 *
 * On UNIX, the GLib mainloop is incompatible with fork(). Any program
 * using the mainloop must either exec() or exit() from the child
 * without returning to the mainloop.
 *
 * ## Memory management of sources # {#mainloop-memory-management}
 *
 * There are two options for memory management of the user data passed to a
 * #GSource to be passed to its callback on invocation. This data is provided
 * in calls to g_timeout_add(), g_timeout_add_full(), g_idle_add(), etc. and
 * more generally, using g_source_set_callback(). This data is typically an
 * object which ‘owns’ the timeout or idle callback, such as a widget or a
 * network protocol implementation. In many cases, it is an error for the
 * callback to be invoked after this owning object has been destroyed, as that
 * results in use of freed memory.
 *
 * The first, and preferred, option is to store the source ID returned by
 * functions such as g_timeout_add() or g_source_attach(), and explicitly
 * remove that source from the main context using g_source_remove() when the
 * owning object is finalized. This ensures that the callback can only be
 * invoked while the object is still alive.
 *
 * The second option is to hold a strong reference to the object in the
 * callback, and to release it in the callback’s #GDestroyNotify. This ensures
 * that the object is kept alive until after the source is finalized, which is
 * guaranteed to be after it is invoked for the final time. The #GDestroyNotify
 * is another callback passed to the ‘full’ variants of #GSource functions (for
 * example, g_timeout_add_full()). It is called when the source is finalized,
 * and is designed for releasing references like this.
 *
 * One important caveat of this second approach is that it will keep the object
 * alive indefinitely if the main loop is stopped before the #GSource is
 * invoked, which may be undesirable.

 * SECTION:markup
 * @Title: Simple XML Subset Parser
 * @Short_description: parses a subset of XML
 * @See_also: [XML Specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/)
 *
 * The "GMarkup" parser is intended to parse a simple markup format
 * that's a subset of XML. This is a small, efficient, easy-to-use
 * parser. It should not be used if you expect to interoperate with
 * other applications generating full-scale XML, and must not be used if you
 * expect to parse untrusted input. However, it's very
 * useful for application data files, config files, etc. where you
 * know your application will be the only one writing the file.
 * Full-scale XML parsers should be able to parse the subset used by
 * GMarkup, so you can easily migrate to full-scale XML at a later
 * time if the need arises.
 *
 * GMarkup is not guaranteed to signal an error on all invalid XML;
 * the parser may accept documents that an XML parser would not.
 * However, XML documents which are not well-formed (which is a
 * weaker condition than being valid. See the
 * [XML specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/)
 * for definitions of these terms.) are not considered valid GMarkup
 * documents.
 *
 * Simplifications to XML include:
 *
 * - Only UTF-8 encoding is allowed
 *
 * - No user-defined entities
 *
 * - Processing instructions, comments and the doctype declaration
 *   are "passed through" but are not interpreted in any way
 *
 * - No DTD or validation
 *
 * The markup format does support:
 *
 * - Elements
 *
 * - Attributes
 *
 * - 5 standard entities: &amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &apos;
 *
 * - Character references
 *
 * - Sections marked as CDATA

/**
 * SECTION:memory
 * @Short_Description: general memory-handling
 * @Title: Memory Allocation
 *
 * These functions provide support for allocating and freeing memory.
 *
 * If any call to allocate memory using functions g_new(), g_new0(), g_renew(),
 * g_malloc(), g_malloc0(), g_malloc0_n(), g_realloc(), and g_realloc_n()
 * fails, the application is terminated. This also means that there is no
 * need to check if the call succeeded. On the other hand, the `g_try_...()` family
 * of functions returns %NULL on failure that can be used as a check
 * for unsuccessful memory allocation. The application is not terminated
 * in this case.
 *
 * As all GLib functions and data structures use `g_malloc()` internally, unless
 * otherwise specified, any allocation failure will result in the application
 * being terminated.
 *
 * It's important to match g_malloc() (and wrappers such as g_new()) with
 * g_free(), g_slice_alloc() (and wrappers such as g_slice_new()) with
 * g_slice_free(), plain malloc() with free(), and (if you're using C++)
 * new with delete and new[] with delete[]. Otherwise bad things can happen,
 * since these allocators may use different memory pools (and new/delete call

 *
 * Since GLib 2.46 g_malloc() is hardcoded to always use the system malloc

/**
 * SECTION:memory_slices
 * @title: Memory Slices
 * @short_description: efficient way to allocate groups of equal-sized
 *     chunks of memory
 *
 * Memory slices provide a space-efficient and multi-processing scalable
 * way to allocate equal-sized pieces of memory, just like the original
 * #GMemChunks (from GLib 2.8), while avoiding their excessive
 * memory-waste, scalability and performance problems.
 *
 * To achieve these goals, the slice allocator uses a sophisticated,
 * layered design that has been inspired by Bonwick's slab allocator
 * ([Bonwick94](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bonwick94slab.html)
 * Jeff Bonwick, The slab allocator: An object-caching kernel
 * memory allocator. USENIX 1994, and
 * [Bonwick01](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bonwick01magazines.html)
 * Bonwick and Jonathan Adams, Magazines and vmem: Extending the
 * slab allocator to many cpu's and arbitrary resources. USENIX 2001)
 *
 * It uses posix_memalign() to optimize allocations of many equally-sized
 * chunks, and has per-thread free lists (the so-called magazine layer)
 * to quickly satisfy allocation requests of already known structure sizes.
 * This is accompanied by extra caching logic to keep freed memory around
 * for some time before returning it to the system. Memory that is unused
 * due to alignment constraints is used for cache colorization (random
 * distribution of chunk addresses) to improve CPU cache utilization. The
 * caching layer of the slice allocator adapts itself to high lock contention
 * to improve scalability.
 *
 * The slice allocator can allocate blocks as small as two pointers, and
 * unlike malloc(), it does not reserve extra space per block. For large block
 * sizes, g_slice_new() and g_slice_alloc() will automatically delegate to the
 * system malloc() implementation. For newly written code it is recommended
 * to use the new `g_slice` API instead of g_malloc() and
 * friends, as long as objects are not resized during their lifetime and the
 * object size used at allocation time is still available when freeing.
 *
 * Here is an example for using the slice allocator:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gchar *mem[10000];
 * gint i;
 *
 * // Allocate 10000 blocks.
 * for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
 *   {
 *     mem[i] = g_slice_alloc (50);
 *
 *     // Fill in the memory with some junk.
 *     for (j = 0; j < 50; j++)
 *       mem[i][j] = i * j;
 *   }
 *
 * // Now free all of the blocks.
 * for (i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
 *   g_slice_free1 (50, mem[i]);
 * ]|
 *
 * And here is an example for using the using the slice allocator
 * with data structures:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GRealArray *array;
 *
 * // Allocate one block, using the g_slice_new() macro.
 * array = g_slice_new (GRealArray);
 *
 * // We can now use array just like a normal pointer to a structure.
 * array->data            = NULL;
 * array->len             = 0;
 * array->alloc           = 0;
 * array->zero_terminated = (zero_terminated ? 1 : 0);
 * array->clear           = (clear ? 1 : 0);
 * array->elt_size        = elt_size;
 *
 * // We can free the block, so it can be reused.
 * g_slice_free (GRealArray, array);
 * ]|

/**
 * SECTION:messages
 * @Title: Message Output and Debugging Functions
 * @Short_description: functions to output messages and help debug applications
 *
 * These functions provide support for outputting messages.
 *
 * The g_return family of macros (g_return_if_fail(),
 * g_return_val_if_fail(), g_return_if_reached(),
 * g_return_val_if_reached()) should only be used for programming
 * errors, a typical use case is checking for invalid parameters at
 * the beginning of a public function. They should not be used if
 * you just mean "if (error) return", they should only be used if
 * you mean "if (bug in program) return". The program behavior is
 * generally considered undefined after one of these checks fails.
 * They are not intended for normal control flow, only to give a
 * perhaps-helpful warning before giving up.
 *
 * Structured logging output is supported using g_log_structured(). This differs
 * from the traditional g_log() API in that log messages are handled as a
 * collection of key–value pairs representing individual pieces of information,
 * rather than as a single string containing all the information in an arbitrary
 * format.
 *
 * The convenience macros g_info(), g_message(), g_debug(), g_warning() and g_error()
 * will use the traditional g_log() API unless you define the symbol
 * %G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED before including `glib.h`. But note that even messages
 * logged through the traditional g_log() API are ultimatively passed to
 * g_log_structured(), so that all log messages end up in same destination.
 * If %G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED is defined, g_test_expect_message() will become
 * ineffective for the wrapper macros g_warning() and friends (see
 * [Testing for Messages][testing-for-messages]).
 *
 * The support for structured logging was motivated by the following needs (some
 * of which were supported previously; others weren’t):
 *  * Support for multiple logging levels.
 *  * Structured log support with the ability to add `MESSAGE_ID`s (see
 *    g_log_structured()).
 *  * Moving the responsibility for filtering log messages from the program to
 *    the log viewer — instead of libraries and programs installing log handlers
 *    (with g_log_set_handler()) which filter messages before output, all log
 *    messages are outputted, and the log viewer program (such as `journalctl`)
 *    must filter them. This is based on the idea that bugs are sometimes hard
 *    to reproduce, so it is better to log everything possible and then use
 *    tools to analyse the logs than it is to not be able to reproduce a bug to
 *    get additional log data. Code which uses logging in performance-critical
 *    sections should compile out the g_log_structured() calls in
 *    release builds, and compile them in in debugging builds.
 *  * A single writer function which handles all log messages in a process, from
 *    all libraries and program code; rather than multiple log handlers with
 *    poorly defined interactions between them. This allows a program to easily
 *    change its logging policy by changing the writer function, for example to
 *    log to an additional location or to change what logging output fallbacks
 *    are used. The log writer functions provided by GLib are exposed publicly
 *    so they can be used from programs’ log writers. This allows log writer
 *    policy and implementation to be kept separate.
 *  * If a library wants to add standard information to all of its log messages
 *    (such as library state) or to redact private data (such as passwords or
 *    network credentials), it should use a wrapper function around its
 *    g_log_structured() calls or implement that in the single log writer
 *    function.
 *  * If a program wants to pass context data from a g_log_structured() call to
 *    its log writer function so that, for example, it can use the correct
 *    server connection to submit logs to, that user data can be passed as a
 *    zero-length #GLogField to g_log_structured_array().
 *  * Color output needed to be supported on the terminal, to make reading
 *    through logs easier.
 *
 * ## Using Structured Logging ## {#using-structured-logging}
 *
 * To use structured logging (rather than the old-style logging), either use
 * the g_log_structured() and g_log_structured_array() functions; or define
 * `G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED` before including any GLib header, and use the
 * g_message(), g_debug(), g_error() (etc.) macros.
 *
 * You do not need to define `G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED` to use g_log_structured(),
 * but it is a good idea to avoid confusion.
 *
 * ## Log Domains ## {#log-domains}
 *
 * Log domains may be used to broadly split up the origins of log messages.
 * Typically, there are one or a few log domains per application or library.
 * %G_LOG_DOMAIN should be used to define the default log domain for the current
 * compilation unit — it is typically defined at the top of a source file, or in
 * the preprocessor flags for a group of source files.
 *
 * Log domains must be unique, and it is recommended that they are the
 * application or library name, optionally followed by a hyphen and a sub-domain
 * name. For example, `bloatpad` or `bloatpad-io`.
 *
 * ## Debug Message Output ## {#debug-message-output}
 *
 * The default log functions (g_log_default_handler() for the old-style API and
 * g_log_writer_default() for the structured API) both drop debug and
 * informational messages by default, unless the log domains of those messages
 * are listed in the `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG` environment variable (or it is set to
 * `all`).
 *
 * It is recommended that custom log writer functions re-use the
 * `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG` environment variable, rather than inventing a custom one,
 * so that developers can re-use the same debugging techniques and tools across
 * projects.
 *
 * ## Testing for Messages ## {#testing-for-messages}
 *
 * With the old g_log() API, g_test_expect_message() and
 * g_test_assert_expected_messages() could be used in simple cases to check
 * whether some code under test had emitted a given log message. These
 * functions have been deprecated with the structured logging API, for several
 * reasons:
 *  * They relied on an internal queue which was too inflexible for many use
 *    cases, where messages might be emitted in several orders, some
 *    messages might not be emitted deterministically, or messages might be
 *    emitted by unrelated log domains.
 *  * They do not support structured log fields.
 *  * Examining the log output of code is a bad approach to testing it, and
 *    while it might be necessary for legacy code which uses g_log(), it should
 *    be avoided for new code using g_log_structured().
 *
 * They will continue to work as before if g_log() is in use (and
 * %G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED is not defined). They will do nothing if used with the
 * structured logging API.
 *
 * Examining the log output of code is discouraged: libraries should not emit to
 * `stderr` during defined behaviour, and hence this should not be tested. If
 * the log emissions of a library during undefined behaviour need to be tested,
 * they should be limited to asserting that the library aborts and prints a
 * suitable error message before aborting. This should be done with
 * g_test_trap_assert_stderr().
 *
 * If it is really necessary to test the structured log messages emitted by a
 * particular piece of code – and the code cannot be restructured to be more
 * suitable to more conventional unit testing – you should write a custom log
 * writer function (see g_log_set_writer_func()) which appends all log messages
 * to a queue. When you want to check the log messages, examine and clear the
 * queue, ignoring irrelevant log messages (for example, from log domains other
 * than the one under test).

/**
 * SECTION:option
 * @Short_description: parses commandline options
 * @Title: Commandline option parser
 *
 * The GOption commandline parser is intended to be a simpler replacement
 * for the popt library. It supports short and long commandline options,
 * as shown in the following example:
 *
 * `testtreemodel -r 1 --max-size 20 --rand --display=:1.0 -vb -- file1 file2`
 *
 * The example demonstrates a number of features of the GOption
 * commandline parser:
 *
 * - Options can be single letters, prefixed by a single dash.
 *
 * - Multiple short options can be grouped behind a single dash.
 *
 * - Long options are prefixed by two consecutive dashes.
 *
 * - Options can have an extra argument, which can be a number, a string or
 *   a filename. For long options, the extra argument can be appended with
 *   an equals sign after the option name, which is useful if the extra
 *   argument starts with a dash, which would otherwise cause it to be
 *   interpreted as another option.
 *
 * - Non-option arguments are returned to the application as rest arguments.
 *
 * - An argument consisting solely of two dashes turns off further parsing,
 *   any remaining arguments (even those starting with a dash) are returned
 *   to the application as rest arguments.
 *
 * Another important feature of GOption is that it can automatically
 * generate nicely formatted help output. Unless it is explicitly turned
 * off with g_option_context_set_help_enabled(), GOption will recognize
 * the `--help`, `-?`, `--help-all` and `--help-groupname` options
 * (where `groupname` is the name of a #GOptionGroup) and write a text
 * similar to the one shown in the following example to stdout.
 *
 * |[
 * Usage:
 *   testtreemodel [OPTION...] - test tree model performance
 *  
 * Help Options:
 *   -h, --help               Show help options
 *   --help-all               Show all help options
 *   --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options
 *  
 * Application Options:
 *   -r, --repeats=N          Average over N repetitions
 *   -m, --max-size=M         Test up to 2^M items
 *   --display=DISPLAY        X display to use
 *   -v, --verbose            Be verbose
 *   -b, --beep               Beep when done
 *   --rand                   Randomize the data
 * ]|
 *
 * GOption groups options in #GOptionGroups, which makes it easy to
 * incorporate options from multiple sources. The intended use for this is
 * to let applications collect option groups from the libraries it uses,
 * add them to their #GOptionContext, and parse all options by a single call
 * to g_option_context_parse(). See gtk_get_option_group() for an example.
 *
 * If an option is declared to be of type string or filename, GOption takes
 * care of converting it to the right encoding; strings are returned in
 * UTF-8, filenames are returned in the GLib filename encoding. Note that
 * this only works if setlocale() has been called before
 * g_option_context_parse().
 *
 * Here is a complete example of setting up GOption to parse the example
 * commandline above and produce the example help output.

 *       exit (1);
 *     }
 *
 *   ...
 *
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * On UNIX systems, the argv that is passed to main() has no particular
 * encoding, even to the extent that different parts of it may have
 * different encodings.  In general, normal arguments and flags will be
 * in the current locale and filenames should be considered to be opaque
 * byte strings.  Proper use of %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME vs
 * %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING is therefore important.
 *
 * Note that on Windows, filenames do have an encoding, but using
 * #GOptionContext with the argv as passed to main() will result in a
 * program that can only accept commandline arguments with characters
 * from the system codepage.  This can cause problems when attempting to
 * deal with filenames containing Unicode characters that fall outside
 * of the codepage.
 *
 * A solution to this is to use g_win32_get_command_line() and
 * g_option_context_parse_strv() which will properly handle full Unicode
 * filenames.  If you are using #GApplication, this is done
 * automatically for you.
 *
 * The following example shows how you can use #GOptionContext directly
 * in order to correctly deal with Unicode filenames on Windows:
 *

 * #else
 *   args = g_strdupv (argv);
 * #endif
 *
 *   // set up context
 *
 *   if (!g_option_context_parse_strv (context, &args, &error))
 *     {

 * If you just need a random number, you simply call the g_random_*
 * functions, which will create a globally used #GRand and use the
 * according g_rand_* functions internally. Whenever you need a
 * stream of reproducible random numbers, you better create a
 * #GRand yourself and use the g_rand_* functions directly, which
 * will also be slightly faster. Initializing a #GRand with a
 * certain seed will produce exactly the same series of random
 * numbers on all platforms. This can thus be used as a seed for
 * e.g. games.
 *
 * The g_rand*_range functions will return high quality equally
 * distributed random numbers, whereas for example the
 * `(g_random_int()%max)` approach often
 * doesn't yield equally distributed numbers.
 *
 * GLib changed the seeding algorithm for the pseudo-random number
 * generator Mersenne Twister, as used by #GRand. This was necessary,
 * because some seeds would yield very bad pseudo-random streams.
 * Also the pseudo-random integers generated by g_rand*_int_range()
 * will have a slightly better equal distribution with the new
 * version of GLib.
 *
 * The original seeding and generation algorithms, as found in
 * GLib 2.0.x, can be used instead of the new ones by setting the
 * environment variable `G_RANDOM_VERSION` to the value of '2.0'.
 * Use the GLib-2.0 algorithms only if you have sequences of numbers
 * generated with Glib-2.0 that you need to reproduce exactly.

/**
 * SECTION:rcbox
 * @Title: Reference counted data
 * @Short_description: Allocated memory with reference counting semantics
 *
 * A "reference counted box", or "RcBox", is an opaque wrapper data type
 * that is guaranteed to be as big as the size of a given data type, and
 * which augments the given data type with reference counting semantics
 * for its memory management.
 *
 * RcBox is useful if you have a plain old data type, like a structure
 * typically placed on the stack, and you wish to provide additional API
 * to use it on the heap; or if you want to implement a new type to be
 * passed around by reference without necessarily implementing copy/free
 * semantics or your own reference counting.
 *
 * The typical use is:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * typedef struct {
 *   char *name;
 *   char *address;
 *   char *city;
 *   char *state;
 *   int age;
 * } Person;
 *
 * Person *
 * person_new (void)
 * {
 *   return g_rc_box_new0 (Person);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Every time you wish to acquire a reference on the memory, you should
 * call g_rc_box_acquire(); similarly, when you wish to release a reference
 * you should call g_rc_box_release():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * // Add a Person to the Database; the Database acquires ownership
 * // of the Person instance
 * void
 * add_person_to_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_prepend (db->persons, g_rc_box_acquire (p));
 * }
 *
 * // Removes a Person from the Database; the reference acquired by
 * // add_person_to_database() is released here
 * void
 * remove_person_from_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_remove (db->persons, p);
 *   g_rc_box_release (p);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If you have additional memory allocated inside the structure, you can
 * use g_rc_box_release_full(), which takes a function pointer, which
 * will be called if the reference released was the last:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * void
 * person_clear (Person *p)
 * {
 *   g_free (p->name);
 *   g_free (p->address);
 *   g_free (p->city);
 *   g_free (p->state);
 * }
 *
 * void
 * remove_person_from_database (Database *db, Person *p)
 * {
 *   db->persons = g_list_remove (db->persons, p);
 *   g_rc_box_release_full (p, (GDestroyNotify) person_clear);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If you wish to transfer the ownership of a reference counted data
 * type without increasing the reference count, you can use g_steal_pointer():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   Person *p = g_rc_box_new (Person);
 *
 *   // fill_person_details() is defined elsewhere
 *   fill_person_details (p);
 *
 *   // add_person_to_database_no_ref() is defined elsewhere; it adds
 *   // a Person to the Database without taking a reference
 *   add_person_to_database_no_ref (db, g_steal_pointer (&p));
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Thread safety
 *
 * The reference counting operations on data allocated using g_rc_box_alloc(),
 * g_rc_box_new(), and g_rc_box_dup() are not thread safe; it is your code's
 * responsibility to ensure that references are acquired are released on the
 * same thread.
 *
 * If you need thread safe reference counting, see the [atomic reference counted
 * data][arcbox] API.
 *
 * ## Automatic pointer clean up
 *
 * If you want to add g_autoptr() support to your plain old data type through
 * reference counting, you can use the G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC() and
 * g_rc_box_release():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC (MyDataStruct, g_rc_box_release)
 * ]|
 *
 * If you need to clear the contents of the data, you will need to use an
 * ancillary function that calls g_rc_box_release_full():
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static void
 * my_data_struct_release (MyDataStruct *data)
 * {
 *   // my_data_struct_clear() is defined elsewhere
 *   g_rc_box_release_full (data, (GDestroyNotify) my_data_struct_clear);
 * }
 *
 * G_DEFINE_AUTOPTR_CLEANUP_FUNC (MyDataStruct, my_data_struct_release)

/**
 * SECTION:refcount
 * @Title: Reference counting
 * @Short_description: Reference counting types and functions
 *
 * Reference counting is a garbage collection mechanism that is based on
 * assigning a counter to a data type, or any memory area; the counter is
 * increased whenever a new reference to that data type is acquired, and
 * decreased whenever the reference is released. Once the last reference
 * is released, the resources associated to that data type are freed.
 *
 * GLib uses reference counting in many of its data types, and provides
 * the #grefcount and #gatomicrefcount types to implement safe and atomic
 * reference counting semantics in new data types.
 *
 * It is important to note that #grefcount and #gatomicrefcount should be
 * considered completely opaque types; you should always use the provided

/**
 * SECTION:refstring
 * @Title: Reference counted strings
 * @Short_description: Strings with reference counted memory management
 *
 * Reference counted strings are normal C strings that have been augmented
 * with a reference counter to manage their resources. You allocate a new
 * reference counted string and acquire and release references as needed,
 * instead of copying the string among callers; when the last reference on
 * the string is released, the resources allocated for it are freed.
 *
 * Typically, reference counted strings can be used when parsing data from
 * files and storing them into data structures that are passed to various
 * callers:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * PersonDetails *
 * person_details_from_data (const char *data)
 * {
 *   // Use g_autoptr() to simplify error cases
 *   g_autoptr(GRefString) full_name = NULL;
 *   g_autoptr(GRefString) address =  NULL;
 *   g_autoptr(GRefString) city = NULL;
 *   g_autoptr(GRefString) state = NULL;
 *   g_autoptr(GRefString) zip_code = NULL;
 *
 *   // parse_person_details() is defined elsewhere; returns refcounted strings
 *   if (!parse_person_details (data, &full_name, &address, &city, &state, &zip_code))
 *     return NULL;
 *
 *   if (!validate_zip_code (zip_code))
 *     return NULL;
 *
 *   // add_address_to_cache() and add_full_name_to_cache() are defined
 *   // elsewhere; they add strings to various caches, using refcounted
 *   // strings to avoid copying data over and over again
 *   add_address_to_cache (address, city, state, zip_code);
 *   add_full_name_to_cache (full_name);
 *
 *   // person_details_new() is defined elsewhere; it takes a reference
 *   // on each string
 *   PersonDetails *res = person_details_new (full_name,
 *                                            address,
 *                                            city,
 *                                            state,
 *                                            zip_code);
 *
 *   return res;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * In the example above, we have multiple functions taking the same strings
 * for different uses; with typical C strings, we'd have to copy the strings
 * every time the life time rules of the data differ from the life time of
 * the string parsed from the original buffer. With reference counted strings,
 * each caller can take a reference on the data, and keep it as long as it
 * needs to own the string.
 *
 * Reference counted strings can also be "interned" inside a global table
 * owned by GLib; while an interned string has at least a reference, creating
 * a new interned reference counted string with the same contents will return
 * a reference to the existing string instead of creating a new reference
 * counted string instance. Once the string loses its last reference, it will
 * be automatically removed from the global interned strings table.

 */


/**
 * SECTION:sequence
 * @title: Sequences
 * @short_description: scalable lists
 *
 * The #GSequence data structure has the API of a list, but is
 * implemented internally with a balanced binary tree. This means that
 * it is possible to maintain a sorted list of n elements in time O(n log n).
 * The data contained in each element can be either integer values, by using
 * of the [Type Conversion Macros][glib-Type-Conversion-Macros], or simply
 * pointers to any type of data.
 *
 * A #GSequence is accessed through "iterators", represented by a
 * #GSequenceIter. An iterator represents a position between two
 * elements of the sequence. For example, the "begin" iterator
 * represents the gap immediately before the first element of the
 * sequence, and the "end" iterator represents the gap immediately
 * after the last element. In an empty sequence, the begin and end
 * iterators are the same.
 *
 * Some methods on #GSequence operate on ranges of items. For example
 * g_sequence_foreach_range() will call a user-specified function on
 * each element with the given range. The range is delimited by the
 * gaps represented by the passed-in iterators, so if you pass in the
 * begin and end iterators, the range in question is the entire
 * sequence.
 *
 * The function g_sequence_get() is used with an iterator to access the
 * element immediately following the gap that the iterator represents.
 * The iterator is said to "point" to that element.
 *
 * Iterators are stable across most operations on a #GSequence. For
 * example an iterator pointing to some element of a sequence will
 * continue to point to that element even after the sequence is sorted.
 * Even moving an element to another sequence using for example
 * g_sequence_move_range() will not invalidate the iterators pointing
 * to it. The only operation that will invalidate an iterator is when
 * the element it points to is removed from any sequence.
 *
 * To sort the data, either use g_sequence_insert_sorted() or
 * g_sequence_insert_sorted_iter() to add data to the #GSequence or, if
 * you want to add a large amount of data, it is more efficient to call
 * g_sequence_sort() or g_sequence_sort_iter() after doing unsorted
 * insertions.

/**
 * SECTION:string_utils
 * @title: String Utility Functions
 * @short_description: various string-related functions
 *
 * This section describes a number of utility functions for creating,
 * duplicating, and manipulating strings.
 *
 * Note that the functions g_printf(), g_fprintf(), g_sprintf(),
 * g_vprintf(), g_vfprintf(), g_vsprintf() and g_vasprintf()
 * are declared in the header `gprintf.h` which is not included in `glib.h`
 * (otherwise using `glib.h` would drag in `stdio.h`), so you'll have to
 * explicitly include `<glib/gprintf.h>` in order to use the GLib
 * printf() functions.
 *
 * ## String precision pitfalls # {#string-precision}
 *
 * While you may use the printf() functions to format UTF-8 strings,
 * notice that the precision of a \%Ns parameter is interpreted
 * as the number of bytes, not characters to print. On top of that,
 * the GNU libc implementation of the printf() functions has the
 * "feature" that it checks that the string given for the \%Ns
 * parameter consists of a whole number of characters in the current
 * encoding. So, unless you are sure you are always going to be in an
 * UTF-8 locale or your know your text is restricted to ASCII, avoid
 * using \%Ns. If your intention is to format strings for a
 * certain number of columns, then \%Ns is not a correct solution
 * anyway, since it fails to take wide characters (see g_unichar_iswide())
 * into account.
 *
 * Note also that there are various printf() parameters which are platform
 * dependent. GLib provides platform independent macros for these parameters
 * which should be used instead. A common example is %G_GUINT64_FORMAT, which
 * should be used instead of `%llu` or similar parameters for formatting
 * 64-bit integers. These macros are all named `G_*_FORMAT`; see
 * [Basic Types][glib-Basic-Types].

 * call functions such as strchr() or g_strdup() on it.
 *
 * However, a #GString can also hold arbitrary binary data, because it
 * has a "len" member, which includes any possible embedded nul
 * characters in the data.  Conceptually then, #GString is like a

/**
 * SECTION:testing
 * @title: Testing
 * @short_description: a test framework
 *
 * GLib provides a framework for writing and maintaining unit tests
 * in parallel to the code they are testing. The API is designed according
 * to established concepts found in the other test frameworks (JUnit, NUnit,
 * RUnit), which in turn is based on smalltalk unit testing concepts.
 *
 * - Test case: Tests (test methods) are grouped together with their
 *   fixture into test cases.
 *
 * - Fixture: A test fixture consists of fixture data and setup and
 *   teardown methods to establish the environment for the test
 *   functions. We use fresh fixtures, i.e. fixtures are newly set
 *   up and torn down around each test invocation to avoid dependencies
 *   between tests.
 *
 * - Test suite: Test cases can be grouped into test suites, to allow
 *   subsets of the available tests to be run. Test suites can be
 *   grouped into other test suites as well.
 *
 * The API is designed to handle creation and registration of test suites
 * and test cases implicitly. A simple call like
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   g_test_add_func ("/misc/assertions", test_assertions);
 * ]|
 * creates a test suite called "misc" with a single test case named
 * "assertions", which consists of running the test_assertions function.
 *
 * In addition to the traditional g_assert_true(), the test framework provides
 * an extended set of assertions for comparisons: g_assert_cmpfloat(),
 * g_assert_cmpfloat_with_epsilon(), g_assert_cmpint(), g_assert_cmpuint(),
 * g_assert_cmphex(), g_assert_cmpstr(), g_assert_cmpmem() and
 * g_assert_cmpvariant(). The
 * advantage of these variants over plain g_assert_true() is that the assertion
 * messages can be more elaborate, and include the values of the compared
 * entities.
 *
 * Note that g_assert() should not be used in unit tests, since it is a no-op
 * when compiling with `G_DISABLE_ASSERT`. Use g_assert() in production code,
 * and g_assert_true() in unit tests.
 *
 * A full example of creating a test suite with two tests using fixtures:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * #include <glib.h>
 * #include <locale.h>
 *
 * typedef struct {
 *   MyObject *obj;
 *   OtherObject *helper;
 * } MyObjectFixture;
 *
 * static void

 *   my_object_do_some_complex_setup (fixture->obj, user_data);
 *
 *   fixture->helper = other_object_new ();
 * }
 *
 * static void
 * my_object_fixture_tear_down (MyObjectFixture *fixture,
 *                              gconstpointer user_data)

 *
 * ### Integrating GTest in your project
 *
 * If you are using the [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com) build system, you will
 * typically use the provided `test()` primitive to call the test binaries,
 * e.g.:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 *   test(
 *     'foo',
 *     executable('foo', 'foo.c', dependencies: deps),
 *     env: [
 *       'G_TEST_SRCDIR=@0@'.format(meson.current_source_dir()),
 *       'G_TEST_BUILDDIR=@0@'.format(meson.current_build_dir()),
 *     ],
 *   )
 *
 *   test(
 *     'bar',
 *     executable('bar', 'bar.c', dependencies: deps),
 *     env: [
 *       'G_TEST_SRCDIR=@0@'.format(meson.current_source_dir()),
 *       'G_TEST_BUILDDIR=@0@'.format(meson.current_build_dir()),
 *     ],
 *   )
 * ]|
 *
 * If you are using Autotools, you're strongly encouraged to use the Automake
 * [TAP](https://testanything.org/) harness; GLib provides template files for
 * easily integrating with it:
 *
 *   - [glib-tap.mk](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/blob/glib-2-58/glib-tap.mk)
 *   - [tap-test](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/blob/glib-2-58/tap-test)
 *   - [tap-driver.sh](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/blob/glib-2-58/tap-driver.sh)
 *
 * You can copy these files in your own project's root directory, and then
 * set up your `Makefile.am` file to reference them, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 * include $(top_srcdir)/glib-tap.mk
 *
 * # test binaries
 * test_programs = \
 *   foo \
 *   bar
 *
 * # data distributed in the tarball
 * dist_test_data = \
 *   foo.data.txt \
 *   bar.data.txt
 *
 * # data not distributed in the tarball
 * test_data = \
 *   blah.data.txt
 * ]|
 *
 * Make sure to distribute the TAP files, using something like the following
 * in your top-level `Makefile.am`:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 * EXTRA_DIST += \
 *   tap-driver.sh \
 *   tap-test
 * ]|
 *
 * `glib-tap.mk` will be distributed implicitly due to being included in a
 * `Makefile.am`. All three files should be added to version control.
 *
 * If you don't have access to the Autotools TAP harness, you can use the
 * [gtester][gtester] and [gtester-report][gtester-report] tools, and use
 * the [glib.mk](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/blob/glib-2-58/glib.mk)
 * Automake template provided by GLib. Note, however, that since GLib 2.62,
 * [gtester][gtester] and [gtester-report][gtester-report] have been deprecated
 * in favour of using TAP. The `--tap` argument to tests is enabled by default
 * as of GLib 2.62.

 * @short_description: pools of threads to execute work concurrently
 * @see_also: #GThread
 *
 * Sometimes you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work
 * and continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often,
 * the overhead of starting and destroying a thread each time might be
 * too high. In such cases reusing already started threads seems like a
 * good idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious
 * and error-prone.
 *
 * Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added
 * advantage is, that the threads can be shared between the different
 * subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.
 *
 * To create a new thread pool, you use g_thread_pool_new().
 * It is destroyed by g_thread_pool_free().
 *
 * If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool,
 * you call g_thread_pool_push().
 *
 * To get the current number of running threads you call
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_threads(). To get the number of still
 * unprocessed tasks you call g_thread_pool_unprocessed(). To control
 * the maximal number of threads for a thread pool, you use
 * g_thread_pool_get_max_threads() and g_thread_pool_set_max_threads().
 *
 * Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept
 * alive by GLib for future use. The current number can be fetched with
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_unused_threads(). The maximal number can be
 * controlled by g_thread_pool_get_max_unused_threads() and
 * g_thread_pool_set_max_unused_threads(). All currently unused threads
 * can be stopped by calling g_thread_pool_stop_unused_threads().

/**
 * SECTION:threads
 * @title: Threads
 * @short_description: portable support for threads, mutexes, locks,
 *     conditions and thread private data
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool, #GAsyncQueue
 *
 * Threads act almost like processes, but unlike processes all threads
 * of one process share the same memory. This is good, as it provides
 * easy communication between the involved threads via this shared
 * memory, and it is bad, because strange things (so called
 * "Heisenbugs") might happen if the program is not carefully designed.
 * In particular, due to the concurrent nature of threads, no
 * assumptions on the order of execution of code running in different
 * threads can be made, unless order is explicitly forced by the
 * programmer through synchronization primitives.
 *
 * The aim of the thread-related functions in GLib is to provide a
 * portable means for writing multi-threaded software. There are
 * primitives for mutexes to protect the access to portions of memory
 * (#GMutex, #GRecMutex and #GRWLock). There is a facility to use
 * individual bits for locks (g_bit_lock()). There are primitives
 * for condition variables to allow synchronization of threads (#GCond).
 * There are primitives for thread-private data - data that every
 * thread has a private instance of (#GPrivate). There are facilities
 * for one-time initialization (#GOnce, g_once_init_enter()). Finally,
 * there are primitives to create and manage threads (#GThread).
 *
 * The GLib threading system used to be initialized with g_thread_init().
 * This is no longer necessary. Since version 2.32, the GLib threading
 * system is automatically initialized at the start of your program,
 * and all thread-creation functions and synchronization primitives
 * are available right away.
 *
 * Note that it is not safe to assume that your program has no threads
 * even if you don't call g_thread_new() yourself. GLib and GIO can
 * and will create threads for their own purposes in some cases, such
 * as when using g_unix_signal_source_new() or when using GDBus.
 *
 * Originally, UNIX did not have threads, and therefore some traditional
 * UNIX APIs are problematic in threaded programs. Some notable examples
 * are
 *
 * - C library functions that return data in statically allocated
 *   buffers, such as strtok() or strerror(). For many of these,
 *   there are thread-safe variants with a _r suffix, or you can
 *   look at corresponding GLib APIs (like g_strsplit() or g_strerror()).
 *
 * - The functions setenv() and unsetenv() manipulate the process
 *   environment in a not thread-safe way, and may interfere with getenv()
 *   calls in other threads. Note that getenv() calls may be hidden behind
 *   other APIs. For example, GNU gettext() calls getenv() under the
 *   covers. In general, it is best to treat the environment as readonly.
 *   If you absolutely have to modify the environment, do it early in
 *   main(), when no other threads are around yet.
 *
 * - The setlocale() function changes the locale for the entire process,
 *   affecting all threads. Temporary changes to the locale are often made
 *   to change the behavior of string scanning or formatting functions
 *   like scanf() or printf(). GLib offers a number of string APIs
 *   (like g_ascii_formatd() or g_ascii_strtod()) that can often be
 *   used as an alternative. Or you can use the uselocale() function
 *   to change the locale only for the current thread.
 *
 * - The fork() function only takes the calling thread into the child's
 *   copy of the process image. If other threads were executing in critical
 *   sections they could have left mutexes locked which could easily
 *   cause deadlocks in the new child. For this reason, you should
 *   call exit() or exec() as soon as possible in the child and only
 *   make signal-safe library calls before that.
 *
 * - The daemon() function uses fork() in a way contrary to what is
 *   described above. It should not be used with GLib programs.
 *
 * GLib itself is internally completely thread-safe (all global data is
 * automatically locked), but individual data structure instances are
 * not automatically locked for performance reasons. For example,
 * you must coordinate accesses to the same #GHashTable from multiple
 * threads. The two notable exceptions from this rule are #GMainLoop
 * and #GAsyncQueue, which are thread-safe and need no further
 * application-level locking to be accessed from multiple threads.
 * Most refcounting functions such as g_object_ref() are also thread-safe.
 *
 * A common use for #GThreads is to move a long-running blocking operation out
 * of the main thread and into a worker thread. For GLib functions, such as
 * single GIO operations, this is not necessary, and complicates the code.
 * Instead, the `…_async()` version of the function should be used from the main
 * thread, eliminating the need for locking and synchronisation between multiple
 * threads. If an operation does need to be moved to a worker thread, consider
 * using g_task_run_in_thread(), or a #GThreadPool. #GThreadPool is often a
 * better choice than #GThread, as it handles thread reuse and task queueing;
 * #GTask uses this internally.
 *
 * However, if multiple blocking operations need to be performed in sequence,
 * and it is not possible to use #GTask for them, moving them to a worker thread
 * can clarify the code.

 *
 * Each time zone has an identifier (for example, ‘Europe/London’) which is
 * platform dependent. See g_time_zone_new() for information on the identifier
 * formats. The identifier of a time zone can be retrieved using
 * g_time_zone_get_identifier().
 *
 * A time zone contains a number of intervals.  Each interval has
 * an abbreviation to describe it (for example, ‘PDT’), an offset to UTC and a
 * flag indicating if the daylight savings time is in effect during that
 * interval.  A time zone always has at least one interval — interval 0. Note
 * that interval abbreviations are not the same as time zone identifiers
 * (apart from ‘UTC’), and cannot be passed to g_time_zone_new().
 *
 * Every UTC time is contained within exactly one interval, but a given
 * local time may be contained within zero, one or two intervals (due to
 * incontinuities associated with daylight savings time).
 *
 * An interval may refer to a specific period of time (eg: the duration
 * of daylight savings time during 2010) or it may refer to many periods
 * of time that share the same properties (eg: all periods of daylight
 * savings time).  It is also possible (usually for political reasons)
 * that some properties (like the abbreviation) change between intervals
 * without other properties changing.

/**
 * SECTION:type_conversion
 * @title: Type Conversion Macros
 * @short_description: portably storing integers in pointer variables
 *
 * Many times GLib, GTK+, and other libraries allow you to pass "user
 * data" to a callback, in the form of a void pointer. From time to time
 * you want to pass an integer instead of a pointer. You could allocate
 * an integer, with something like:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   int *ip = g_new (int, 1);
 *   *ip = 42;
 * ]|
 * But this is inconvenient, and it's annoying to have to free the
 * memory at some later time.
 *
 * Pointers are always at least 32 bits in size (on all platforms GLib
 * intends to support). Thus you can store at least 32-bit integer values
 * in a pointer value. Naively, you might try this, but it's incorrect:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer p;
 *   int i;
 *   p = (void*) 42;
 *   i = (int) p;
 * ]|
 * Again, that example was not correct, don't copy it.
 * The problem is that on some systems you need to do this:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer p;
 *   int i;
 *   p = (void*) (long) 42;
 *   i = (int) (long) p;
 * ]|
 * The GLib macros GPOINTER_TO_INT(), GINT_TO_POINTER(), etc. take care
 * to do the right thing on every platform.
 *
 * Warning: You may not store pointers in integers. This is not
 * portable in any way, shape or form. These macros only allow storing
 * integers in pointers, and only preserve 32 bits of the integer; values
 * outside the range of a 32-bit integer will be mangled.

/**

 * - New types which are not part of standard C (but are defined in
 *   various C standard library header files) — #gboolean, #gssize.
 * - Integer types which are guaranteed to be the same size across
 *   all platforms — #gint8, #guint8, #gint16, #guint16, #gint32,
 *   #guint32, #gint64, #guint64.
 * - Types which are easier to use than their standard C counterparts -
 *   #gpointer, #gconstpointer, #guchar, #guint, #gushort, #gulong.
 * - Types which correspond exactly to standard C types, but are
 *   included for completeness — #gchar, #gint, #gshort, #glong,
 *   #gfloat, #gdouble.
 * - Types which correspond exactly to standard C99 types, but are available
 *   to use even if your compiler does not support C99 — #gsize, #goffset,
 *   #gintptr, #guintptr.
 *
 * GLib also defines macros for the limits of some of the standard
 * integer and floating point types, as well as macros for suitable
 * printf() formats for these types.
 *
 * Note that depending on the platform and build configuration, the format

/**
 * SECTION:warnings
 * @title: Warnings and Assertions
 * @short_description: warnings and assertions to use in runtime code
 *
 * GLib defines several warning functions and assertions which can be used to
 * warn of programmer errors when calling functions, and print error messages
 * from command line programs.
 *
 * The g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail(), g_return_if_reached() and
 * g_return_val_if_reached() macros are intended as pre-condition assertions, to
 * be used at the top of a public function to check that the function’s
 * arguments are acceptable. Any failure of such a pre-condition assertion is
 * considered a programming error on the part of the caller of the public API,
 * and the program is considered to be in an undefined state afterwards. They
 * are similar to the libc assert() function, but provide more context on
 * failures.
 *
 * For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * gboolean
 * g_dtls_connection_shutdown (GDtlsConnection  *conn,
 *                             gboolean          shutdown_read,
 *                             gboolean          shutdown_write,
 *                             GCancellable     *cancellable,
 *                             GError          **error)
 * {

 *   g_return_val_if_fail (error == NULL || *error == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 *   // function body
 *
 *   return return_val;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * g_print(), g_printerr() and g_set_print_handler() are intended to be used for

/**
 * g_atexit:
 * @func: (scope async): the function to call on normal program termination.
 *
 * Specifies a function to be called at normal program termination.
 *
 * Since GLib 2.8.2, on Windows g_atexit() actually is a preprocessor
 * macro that maps to a call to the atexit() function in the C
 * library. This means that in case the code that calls g_atexit(),
 * i.e. atexit(), is in a DLL, the function will be called when the
 * DLL is detached from the program. This typically makes more sense
 * than that the function is called when the GLib DLL is detached,
 * which happened earlier when g_atexit() was a function in the GLib
 * DLL.
 *
 * The behaviour of atexit() in the context of dynamically loaded
 * modules is not formally specified and varies wildly.
 *
 * On POSIX systems, calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) in a dynamically
 * loaded module which is unloaded before the program terminates might
 * well cause a crash at program exit.
 *
 * Some POSIX systems implement atexit() like Windows, and have each
 * dynamically loaded module maintain an own atexit chain that is
 * called when the module is unloaded.
 *
 * On other POSIX systems, before a dynamically loaded module is
 * unloaded, the registered atexit functions (if any) residing in that
 * module are called, regardless where the code that registered them
 * resided. This is presumably the most robust approach.
 *
 * As can be seen from the above, for portability it's best to avoid
 * calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) except in the main executable of a
 * program.

 * Deprecated: 2.32: It is best to avoid g_atexit().

 * g_critical:
 * @...: format string, followed by parameters to insert
 *     into the format string (as with printf())
 *
 * Logs a "critical warning" (#G_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL).
 *
 * Critical warnings are intended to be used in the event of an error
 * that originated in the current process (a programmer error).
 * Logging of a critical error is by definition an indication of a bug
 * somewhere in the current program (or its libraries).
 *
 * g_return_if_fail(), g_return_val_if_fail(), g_return_if_reached() and
 * g_return_val_if_reached() log at %G_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL.
 *
 * You can make critical warnings fatal at runtime by
 * setting the `G_DEBUG` environment variable (see
 * [Running GLib Applications](glib-running.html)):
 *
 * |[
 *   G_DEBUG=fatal-warnings gdb ./my-program
 * ]|
 *
 * You can also use g_log_set_always_fatal().
 *
 * Any unrelated failures can be skipped over in
 * [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) using the `continue` command.
 *
 * The message should typically *not* be translated to the
 * user's language.
 *
 * If g_log_default_handler() is used as the log handler function, a new-line
 * character will automatically be appended to @..., and need not be entered
 * manually.
 *
 * If structured logging is enabled, this will use g_log_structured();
 * otherwise it will use g_log(). See
 * [Using Structured Logging][using-structured-logging].

 * The format strings understood by this function are a subset of the

 * extensions \%k, \%l, \%s and \%P are supported, however, as are the
 * '0', '_' and '-' modifiers.
 *
 * In contrast to strftime(), this function always produces a UTF-8
 * string, regardless of the current locale.  Note that the rendering of
 * many formats is locale-dependent and may not match the strftime()
 * output exactly.
 *
 * The following format specifiers are supported:
 *
 * - \%a: the abbreviated weekday name according to the current locale
 * - \%A: the full weekday name according to the current locale
 * - \%b: the abbreviated month name according to the current locale
 * - \%B: the full month name according to the current locale
 * - \%c: the preferred date and time representation for the current locale
 * - \%C: the century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer (00-99)
 * - \%d: the day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31)
 * - \%e: the day of the month as a decimal number (range  1 to 31)
 * - \%F: equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d` (the ISO 8601 date format)
 * - \%g: the last two digits of the ISO 8601 week-based year as a
 *   decimal number (00-99). This works well with \%V and \%u.
 * - \%G: the ISO 8601 week-based year as a decimal number. This works
 *   well with \%V and \%u.
 * - \%h: equivalent to \%b
 * - \%H: the hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00 to 23)
 * - \%I: the hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01 to 12)
 * - \%j: the day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366)
 * - \%k: the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23);
 *   single digits are preceded by a blank
 * - \%l: the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 1 to 12);
 *   single digits are preceded by a blank
 * - \%m: the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12)
 * - \%M: the minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59)
 * - \%p: either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the
 *   corresponding  strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated as
 *   "PM" and midnight as "AM". Use of this format specifier is discouraged, as
 *   many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use \%c or \%X instead.
 * - \%P: like \%p but lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding string for
 *   the current locale. Use of this format specifier is discouraged, as
 *   many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use \%c or \%X instead.
 * - \%r: the time in a.m. or p.m. notation. Use of this format specifier is
 *   discouraged, as many locales have no concept of AM/PM formatting. Use \%c
 *   or \%X instead.
 * - \%R: the time in 24-hour notation (\%H:\%M)
 * - \%s: the number of seconds since the Epoch, that is, since 1970-01-01
 *   00:00:00 UTC
 * - \%S: the second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60)
 * - \%t: a tab character
 * - \%T: the time in 24-hour notation with seconds (\%H:\%M:\%S)
 * - \%u: the ISO 8601 standard day of the week as a decimal, range 1 to 7,
 *    Monday being 1. This works well with \%G and \%V.
 * - \%V: the ISO 8601 standard week number of the current year as a decimal
 *   number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week that has at
 *   least 4 days in the new year. See g_date_time_get_week_of_year().
 *   This works well with \%G and \%u.
 * - \%w: the day of the week as a decimal, range 0 to 6, Sunday being 0.
 *   This is not the ISO 8601 standard format -- use \%u instead.
 * - \%x: the preferred date representation for the current locale without
 *   the time
 * - \%X: the preferred time representation for the current locale without
 *   the date
 * - \%y: the year as a decimal number without the century
 * - \%Y: the year as a decimal number including the century
 * - \%z: the time zone as an offset from UTC (+hhmm)
 * - \%:z: the time zone as an offset from UTC (+hh:mm).
 *   This is a gnulib strftime() extension. Since: 2.38
 * - \%::z: the time zone as an offset from UTC (+hh:mm:ss). This is a
 *   gnulib strftime() extension. Since: 2.38
 * - \%:::z: the time zone as an offset from UTC, with : to necessary
 *   precision (e.g., -04, +05:30). This is a gnulib strftime() extension. Since: 2.38
 * - \%Z: the time zone or name or abbreviation
 * - \%\%: a literal \% character
 *
 * Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the
 * conversion specifier by one or more modifier characters. The
 * following modifiers are supported for many of the numeric
 * conversions:
 *
 * - O: Use alternative numeric symbols, if the current locale supports those.
 * - _: Pad a numeric result with spaces. This overrides the default padding
 *   for the specifier.
 * - -: Do not pad a numeric result. This overrides the default padding
 *   for the specifier.
 * - 0: Pad a numeric result with zeros. This overrides the default padding
 *   for the specifier.
 *
 * Additionally, when O is used with B, b, or h, it produces the alternative
 * form of a month name. The alternative form should be used when the month
 * name is used without a day number (e.g., standalone). It is required in
 * some languages (Baltic, Slavic, Greek, and more) due to their grammatical
 * rules. For other languages there is no difference. \%OB is a GNU and BSD
 * strftime() extension expected to be added to the future POSIX specification,
 * \%Ob and \%Oh are GNU strftime() extensions. Since: 2.56
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full) (nullable): a newly allocated string formatted to
 *    the requested format or %NULL in the case that there was an error (such
 *    as a format specifier not being supported in the current locale). The
 *    string should be freed with g_free().

 * - there is no translations available for the default text domain

 *
 * - On UNIX, if @filename already exists hard links to @filename will break.
 *   Also since the file is recreated, existing permissions, access control
 *   lists, metadata etc. may be lost. If @filename is a symbolic link,

 *
 * - On UNIX, if @filename already exists and is non-empty, and if the system

 *   will contain either its old contents or @contents, even in the face of

 *
 * - On UNIX, if @filename does not already exist or is empty, there is a

 *
 * - On Windows renaming a file will not remove an existing file with the

 * The first character set from the @charsets is the filename encoding, the

 *
 * On Unix, the character sets are determined by consulting the

 * On Windows, the character set used in the GLib API is always UTF-8
 * and said environment variables have no effect.
 *
 * `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` may be set to a comma-separated list of
 * character set names. The special token "\@locale" is taken
 * to  mean the character set for the [current locale][setlocale].
 * If `G_FILENAME_ENCODING` is not set, but `G_BROKEN_FILENAMES` is,
 * the character set of the current locale is taken as the filename
 * encoding. If neither environment variable  is set, UTF-8 is taken
 * as the filename encoding, but the character set of the current locale
 * is also put in the list of encodings.

 *
 * The @log_domain will be converted into a `GLIB_DOMAIN` field. @log_level will
 * be converted into a
 * [`PRIORITY`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html#PRIORITY=)
 * field. The format string will have its placeholders substituted for the provided
 * values and be converted into a
 * [`MESSAGE`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html#MESSAGE=)
 * field.
 *
 * Other fields you may commonly want to pass into this function:

 *  * [`ERRNO`](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html#ERRNO=)
 *
 * Note that `CODE_FILE`, `CODE_LINE` and `CODE_FUNC` are automatically set by
 * the logging macros, G_DEBUG_HERE(), g_message(), g_warning(), g_critical(),
 * g_error(), etc, if the symbols `G_LOG_USE_STRUCTURED` is defined before including
 * glib.h.
 *
 * For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->

 *                   "MESSAGE", "This is a debug message about pointer %p and integer %u.",
 *                   some_pointer, some_integer);
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that each `MESSAGE_ID` must be [uniquely and randomly
 * generated](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.journal-fields.html#MESSAGE_ID=).
 * If adding a `MESSAGE_ID`, consider shipping a [message
 * catalog](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/catalog/) with
 * your software.
 *
 * To pass a user data pointer to the log writer function which is specific to
 * this logging call, you must use g_log_structured_array() and pass the pointer
 * as a field with #GLogField.length set to zero, otherwise it will be
 * interpreted as a string.
 *
 * For example:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * const GLogField fields[] = {
 *   { "MESSAGE", "This is a debug message.", -1 },
 *   { "MESSAGE_ID", "fcfb2e1e65c3494386b74878f1abf893", -1 },

 *   { "MY_APPLICATION_STATE", state_object, 0 },
 * };
 * g_log_structured_array (G_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG, fields, G_N_ELEMENTS (fields));
 * ]|
 *
 * Note also that, even if no other structured fields are specified, there
 * must always be a `MESSAGE` key before the format string. The `MESSAGE`-format
 * pair has to be the last of the key-value pairs, and `MESSAGE` is the only
 * field for which printf()-style formatting is supported.
 *
 * The default writer function for `stdout` and `stderr` will automatically
 * append a new-line character after the message, so you should not add one

 *

 * control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle
 * function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that
 * doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a

 *

 * these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
 * many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
 * following techniques:
 *
 * 1. Use gtk_widget_set_sensitive() or modal dialogs to prevent
 *    the user from interacting with elements while the main
 *    loop is recursing.
 *
 * 2. Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle

 * The #GMarkupCollectType field allows specifying the type of collection

 * The attribute name is simply the name of the attribute to collect.
 *
 * The pointer should be of the appropriate type (see the descriptions

 *
 * This function deals with issuing errors for missing attributes
 * (of type %G_MARKUP_ERROR_MISSING_ATTRIBUTE), unknown attributes
 * (of type %G_MARKUP_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ATTRIBUTE) and duplicate
 * attributes (of type %G_MARKUP_ERROR_INVALID_CONTENT) as well

 *
 * Executes a child program asynchronously (your program will not
 * block waiting for the child to exit). The child program is
 * specified by the only argument that must be provided, @argv.
 * @argv should be a %NULL-terminated array of strings, to be passed
 * as the argument vector for the child. The first string in @argv
 * is of course the name of the program to execute. By default, the
 * name of the program must be a full path. If @flags contains the
 * %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag, the `PATH` environment variable is
 * used to search for the executable. If @flags contains the
 * %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flag, the `PATH` variable from
 * @envp is used to search for the executable. If both the
 * %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP flags
 * are set, the `PATH` variable from @envp takes precedence over
 * the environment variable.
 *
 * If the program name is not a full path and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag is not
 * used, then the program will be run from the current directory (or
 * @working_directory, if specified); this might be unexpected or even
 * dangerous in some cases when the current directory is world-writable.
 *
 * On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
 * this function and the other g_spawn*() functions are in UTF-8, the
 * GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
 * the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
 * available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
 * to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
 * tools it is enough to make the program have a wmain() instead of
 * main(). wmain() has a wide character argument vector as parameter.
 *
 * At least currently, mingw doesn't support wmain(), so if you use
 * mingw to develop the spawned program, it should call
 * g_win32_get_command_line() to get arguments in UTF-8.
 *
 * On Windows the low-level child process creation API CreateProcess()
 * doesn't use argument vectors, but a command line. The C runtime
 * library's spawn*() family of functions (which g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
 * eventually calls) paste the argument vector elements together into
 * a command line, and the C runtime startup code does a corresponding
 * reconstruction of an argument vector from the command line, to be
 * passed to main(). Complications arise when you have argument vector
 * elements that contain spaces or double quotes. The `spawn*()` functions
 * don't do any quoting or escaping, but on the other hand the startup
 * code does do unquoting and unescaping in order to enable receiving
 * arguments with embedded spaces or double quotes. To work around this
 * asymmetry, g_spawn_async_with_pipes() will do quoting and escaping on
 * argument vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
 * spawn() function.
 *
 * The returned @child_pid on Windows is a handle to the child
 * process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
 * identifiers are different concepts on Windows.
 *
 * @envp is a %NULL-terminated array of strings, where each string
 * has the form `KEY=VALUE`. This will become the child's environment.
 * If @envp is %NULL, the child inherits its parent's environment.
 *
 * @flags should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
 * function's behaviour. The %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD means that the
 * child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a child watch
 * (g_child_watch_add()) to be notified about the death of the child process,
 * otherwise it will stay around as a zombie process until this process exits.
 * Eventually you must call g_spawn_close_pid() on the @child_pid, in order to
 * free resources which may be associated with the child process. (On Unix,
 * using a child watch is equivalent to calling waitpid() or handling
 * the %SIGCHLD signal manually. On Windows, calling g_spawn_close_pid()
 * is equivalent to calling CloseHandle() on the process handle returned
 * in @child_pid). See g_child_watch_add().
 *
 * Open UNIX file descriptors marked as `FD_CLOEXEC` will be automatically
 * closed in the child process. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN means that
 * other open file descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
 * descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before calling exec()
 * in the child. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH means that @argv[0] need not be an
 * absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` environment
 * variable. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP means need not be an
 * absolute path, it will be looked for in the `PATH` variable from
 * @envp. If both %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH and %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP
 * are used, the value from @envp takes precedence over the environment.
 * %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard output
 * will be discarded, instead of going to the same location as the parent's
 * standard output. If you use this flag, @standard_output must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard error
 * will be discarded, instead of going to the same location as the parent's
 * standard error. If you use this flag, @standard_error must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN means that the child will inherit the parent's
 * standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
 * `/dev/null`). If you use this flag, @standard_input must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO means that the first element of @argv is
 * the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the actual
 * argument vector to pass to the file. Normally g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
 * uses @argv[0] as the file to execute, and passes all of @argv to the child.
 *
 * @child_setup and @user_data are a function and user data. On POSIX
 * platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
 * performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
 * pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling exec().
 * That is, @child_setup is called just before calling exec() in the
 * child. Obviously actions taken in this function will only affect
 * the child, not the parent.
 *
 * On Windows, there is no separate fork() and exec() functionality.
 * Child processes are created and run with a single API call,
 * CreateProcess(). There is no sensible thing @child_setup
 * could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.
 *
 * If non-%NULL, @child_pid will on Unix be filled with the child's
 * process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the child,
 * or to use g_child_watch_add() (or waitpid()) if you specified the
 * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. On Windows, @child_pid will be
 * filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
 * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. You can then access the child
 * process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
 * with the WaitFor*() functions, or examine its exit code with
 * GetExitCodeProcess(). You should close the handle with CloseHandle()
 * or g_spawn_close_pid() when you no longer need it.
 *
 * If non-%NULL, the @standard_input, @standard_output, @standard_error
 * locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
 * standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
 * The caller of g_spawn_async_with_pipes() must close these file descriptors
 * when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are %NULL, the
 * corresponding pipe won't be created.
 *
 * If @standard_input is %NULL, the child's standard input is attached to
 * `/dev/null` unless %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN is set.
 *
 * If @standard_error is NULL, the child's standard error goes to the same
 * location as the parent's standard error unless %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL
 * is set.
 *
 * If @standard_output is NULL, the child's standard output goes to the same
 * location as the parent's standard output unless %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL
 * is set.
 *
 * @error can be %NULL to ignore errors, or non-%NULL to report errors.
 * If an error is set, the function returns %FALSE. Errors are reported
 * even if they occur in the child (for example if the executable in
 * @argv[0] is not found). Typically the `message` field of returned
 * errors should be displayed to users. Possible errors are those from
 * the #G_SPAWN_ERROR domain.
 *
 * If an error occurs, @child_pid, @standard_input, @standard_output,
 * and @standard_error will not be filled with valid values.
 *
 * If @child_pid is not %NULL and an error does not occur then the returned
 * process reference must be closed using g_spawn_close_pid().
 *
 * On modern UNIX platforms, GLib can use an efficient process launching
 * codepath driven internally by posix_spawn(). This has the advantage of
 * avoiding the fork-time performance costs of cloning the parent process
 * address space, and avoiding associated memory overcommit checks that are
 * not relevant in the context of immediately executing a distinct process.
 * This optimized codepath will be used provided that the following conditions
 * are met:
 *
 * 1. %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD is set
 * 2. %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN is set
 * 3. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP is not set
 * 4. @working_directory is %NULL
 * 5. @child_setup is %NULL
 * 6. The program is of a recognised binary format, or has a shebang. Otherwise, GLib will have to execute the program through the shell, which is not done using the optimized codepath.
 *
 * If you are writing a GTK+ application, and the program you are spawning is a
 * graphical application too, then to ensure that the spawned program opens its
 * windows on the right screen, you may want to use #GdkAppLaunchContext,
 * #GAppLaunchContext, or set the %DISPLAY environment variable.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE on success, %FALSE if an error was set

/**
 * g_spawn_check_exit_status:
 * @exit_status: An exit code as returned from g_spawn_sync()
 * @error: a #GError
 *
 * Set @error if @exit_status indicates the child exited abnormally
 * (e.g. with a nonzero exit code, or via a fatal signal).
 *
 * The g_spawn_sync() and g_child_watch_add() family of APIs return an
 * exit status for subprocesses encoded in a platform-specific way.
 * On Unix, this is guaranteed to be in the same format waitpid() returns,
 * and on Windows it is guaranteed to be the result of GetExitCodeProcess().
 *
 * Prior to the introduction of this function in GLib 2.34, interpreting
 * @exit_status required use of platform-specific APIs, which is problematic
 * for software using GLib as a cross-platform layer.
 *
 * Additionally, many programs simply want to determine whether or not
 * the child exited successfully, and either propagate a #GError or
 * print a message to standard error. In that common case, this function
 * can be used. Note that the error message in @error will contain
 * human-readable information about the exit status.
 *
 * The @domain and @code of @error have special semantics in the case
 * where the process has an "exit code", as opposed to being killed by
 * a signal. On Unix, this happens if WIFEXITED() would be true of
 * @exit_status. On Windows, it is always the case.
 *
 * The special semantics are that the actual exit code will be the
 * code set in @error, and the domain will be %G_SPAWN_EXIT_ERROR.
 * This allows you to differentiate between different exit codes.
 *
 * If the process was terminated by some means other than an exit
 * status, the domain will be %G_SPAWN_ERROR, and the code will be
 * %G_SPAWN_ERROR_FAILED.
 *
 * This function just offers convenience; you can of course also check
 * the available platform via a macro such as %G_OS_UNIX, and use
 * WIFEXITED() and WEXITSTATUS() on @exit_status directly. Do not attempt
 * to scan or parse the error message string; it may be translated and/or
 * change in future versions of GLib.

 *
 * So far, the following arguments are understood:

 * - `--seed=SEED`: Provide a random seed to reproduce test
 *   runs using random numbers.
 * - `--verbose`: Run tests verbosely.
 * - `-q`, `--quiet`: Run tests quietly.
 * - `-p PATH`: Execute all tests matching the given path.
 * - `-s PATH`: Skip all tests matching the given path.
 *   This can also be used to force a test to run that would otherwise
 *   be skipped (ie, a test whose name contains "/subprocess").
 * - `-m {perf|slow|thorough|quick|undefined|no-undefined}`: Execute tests according to these test modes:
 *
 *   `perf`: Performance tests, may take long and report results (off by default).
 *
 *   `slow`, `thorough`: Slow and thorough tests, may take quite long and maximize coverage
 *   (off by default).
 *
 *   `quick`: Quick tests, should run really quickly and give good coverage (the default).
 *
 *   `undefined`: Tests for undefined behaviour, may provoke programming errors
 *   under g_test_trap_subprocess() or g_test_expect_message() to check
 *   that appropriate assertions or warnings are given (the default).
 *
 *   `no-undefined`: Avoid tests for undefined behaviour
 *
 * - `--debug-log`: Debug test logging output.
 *
 * Options which can be passed to @... are:
 *
 *  - `"no_g_set_prgname"`: Causes g_test_init() to not call g_set_prgname().
 *  - %G_TEST_OPTION_ISOLATE_DIRS: Creates a unique temporary directory for each
 *    unit test and uses g_set_user_dirs() to set XDG directories to point into
 *    that temporary directory for the duration of the unit test. See the

 * In general, the tests and sub-suites within each suite are run in

 * GLib 2.36, there was a bug in the `g_test_add_*`
 * functions which caused them to create multiple suites with the same
 * name, meaning that if you created tests "/foo/simple",
 * "/bar/simple", and "/foo/using-bar" in that order, they would get
 * run in that order (since g_test_run() would run the first "/foo"
 * suite, then the "/bar" suite, then the second "/foo" suite). As of
 * 2.36, this bug is fixed, and adding the tests in that order would
 * result in a running order of "/foo/simple", "/foo/using-bar",
 * "/bar/simple". If this new ordering is sub-optimal (because it puts
 * more-complicated tests before simpler ones, making it harder to
 * figure out exactly what has failed), you can fix it by changing the
 * test paths to group tests by suite in a way that will result in the
 * desired running order. Eg, "/simple/foo", "/simple/bar",
 * "/complex/foo-using-bar".
 *
 * However, you should never make the actual result of a test depend

 * g_test_add(), which lets you specify setup and teardown functions.

/**

 *
 * Gets the command line arguments, on Windows, in the GLib filename

 * arguments if the filenames contain characters that fall outside of
 * this codepage.  If such filenames are passed, then substitutions
 * will occur (such as replacing some characters with '?').
 *
 * GLib's policy of using UTF-8 as a filename encoding on Windows was
 * designed to localise the pain of dealing with filenames outside of

 * in main().
 *
 * As such, most GLib programs should ignore the value of argv passed to

 * The strings returned by this function are suitable for use with
 * functions such as g_open() and g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() but

 *
 * This function is deprecated. Use
 * g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module() instead.
 *
 * The use of @package is deprecated. You should always pass %NULL. A
 * warning is printed if non-NULL is passed as @package.
 *
 * The original intended use of @package was for a short identifier of
 * the package, typically the same identifier as used for
 * `GETTEXT_PACKAGE` in software configured using GNU
 * autotools. The function first looks in the Windows Registry for the
 * value `#InstallationDirectory` in the key
 * `#HKLM\Software\@package`, and if that value
 * exists and is a string, returns that.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended that packagers of GLib-using libraries
 * for Windows do not store installation paths in the Registry to be
 * used by this function as that interfers with having several
 * parallel installations of the library. Enabling multiple
 * installations of different versions of some GLib-using library, or
 * GLib itself, is desirable for various reasons.
 *
 * For this reason it is recommended to always pass %NULL as
 * @package to this function, to avoid the temptation to use the
 * Registry. In version 2.20 of GLib the @package parameter
 * will be ignored and this function won't look in the Registry at all.
 *
 * If @package is %NULL, or the above value isn't found in the
 * Registry, but @dll_name is non-%NULL, it should name a DLL loaded
 * into the current process. Typically that would be the name of the
 * DLL calling this function, looking for its installation
 * directory. The function then asks Windows what directory that DLL
 * was loaded from. If that directory's last component is "bin" or
 * "lib", the parent directory is returned, otherwise the directory
 * itself. If that DLL isn't loaded, the function proceeds as if
 * @dll_name was %NULL.
 *
 * If both @package and @dll_name are %NULL, the directory from where
 * the main executable of the process was loaded is used instead in
 * the same way as above.
 *
 * Returns: a string containing the installation directory for
 * @package. The string is in the GLib file name encoding,
 * i.e. UTF-8. The return value should be freed with g_free() when not
 * needed any longer. If the function fails %NULL is returned.

 * g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module() instead.

/**

 *
 * This function tries to determine the installation directory of a
 * software package based on the location of a DLL of the software
 * package.
 *
 * @hmodule should be the handle of a loaded DLL or %NULL. The
 * function looks up the directory that DLL was loaded from. If
 * @hmodule is NULL, the directory the main executable of the current
 * process is looked up. If that directory's last component is "bin"
 * or "lib", its parent directory is returned, otherwise the directory
 * itself.
 *
 * It thus makes sense to pass only the handle to a "public" DLL of a
 * software package to this function, as such DLLs typically are known
 * to be installed in a "bin" or occasionally "lib" subfolder of the
 * installation folder. DLLs that are of the dynamically loaded module
 * or plugin variety are often located in more private locations
 * deeper down in the tree, from which it is impossible for GLib to
 * deduce the root of the package installation.
 *
 * The typical use case for this function is to have a DllMain() that
 * saves the handle for the DLL. Then when code in the DLL needs to
 * construct names of files in the installation tree it calls this
 * function passing the DLL handle.
 *
 * Returns: a string containing the guessed installation directory for
 * the software package @hmodule is from. The string is in the GLib
