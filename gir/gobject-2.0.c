/**

 *
 * The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has
 * its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.
 *
 * Note that getting this signal doesn’t itself guarantee that the value of
 * the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the
 * derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with
 * %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then any call to g_object_set_property() results
 * in ::notify being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old.
 * If they did pass %G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY, then this signal is emitted only
 * when they explicitly call g_object_notify() or g_object_notify_by_pspec(),
 * and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.
 *
 * This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a
 * single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the
 * g_signal_connect() call, like this:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * g_signal_connect (text_view->buffer, "notify::paste-target-list",

 * @title: Enumeration and Flag Types
 * @see_also: #GParamSpecEnum, #GParamSpecFlags, g_param_spec_enum(),

 *
 * The GLib type system provides fundamental types for enumeration and
 * flags types. (Flags types are like enumerations, but allow their
 * values to be combined by bitwise or). A registered enumeration or

 * value, and the methods g_enum_get_value_by_name(),
 * g_enum_get_value_by_nick(), g_flags_get_value_by_name() and

 * properties, using g_param_spec_enum() or g_param_spec_flags().
 *
 * GObject ships with a utility called [glib-mkenums][glib-mkenums],

/**
 * SECTION:gbinding
 * @Title: GBinding
 * @Short_Description: Bind two object properties
 *
 * #GBinding is the representation of a binding between a property on a
 * #GObject instance (or source) and another property on another #GObject
 * instance (or target). Whenever the source property changes, the same
 * value is applied to the target property; for instance, the following
 * binding:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
 *                           object2, "property-b",
 *                           G_BINDING_DEFAULT);
 * ]|
 *
 * will cause the property named "property-b" of @object2 to be updated
 * every time g_object_set() or the specific accessor changes the value of
 * the property "property-a" of @object1.
 *
 * It is possible to create a bidirectional binding between two properties
 * of two #GObject instances, so that if either property changes, the
 * other is updated as well, for instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   g_object_bind_property (object1, "property-a",
 *                           object2, "property-b",
 *                           G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL);
 * ]|
 *
 * will keep the two properties in sync.
 *
 * It is also possible to set a custom transformation function (in both
 * directions, in case of a bidirectional binding) to apply a custom
 * transformation from the source value to the target value before
 * applying it; for instance, the following binding:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   g_object_bind_property_full (adjustment1, "value",
 *                                adjustment2, "value",
 *                                G_BINDING_BIDIRECTIONAL,
 *                                celsius_to_fahrenheit,
 *                                fahrenheit_to_celsius,
 *                                NULL, NULL);
 * ]|
 *
 * will keep the "value" property of the two adjustments in sync; the
 * @celsius_to_fahrenheit function will be called whenever the "value"
 * property of @adjustment1 changes and will transform the current value
 * of the property before applying it to the "value" property of @adjustment2.
 *
 * Vice versa, the @fahrenheit_to_celsius function will be called whenever
 * the "value" property of @adjustment2 changes, and will transform the
 * current value of the property before applying it to the "value" property
 * of @adjustment1.
 *
 * Note that #GBinding does not resolve cycles by itself; a cycle like
 *
 * |[
 *   object1:propertyA -> object2:propertyB
 *   object2:propertyB -> object3:propertyC
 *   object3:propertyC -> object1:propertyA
 * ]|
 *
 * might lead to an infinite loop. The loop, in this particular case,
 * can be avoided if the objects emit the #GObject::notify signal only
 * if the value has effectively been changed. A binding is implemented
 * using the #GObject::notify signal, so it is susceptible to all the
 * various ways of blocking a signal emission, like g_signal_stop_emission()
 * or g_signal_handler_block().
 *
 * A binding will be severed, and the resources it allocates freed, whenever
 * either one of the #GObject instances it refers to are finalized, or when
 * the #GBinding instance loses its last reference.
 *
 * Bindings for languages with garbage collection can use
 * g_binding_unbind() to explicitly release a binding between the source
 * and target properties, instead of relying on the last reference on the
 * binding, source, and target instances to drop.
 *
 * #GBinding is available since GObject 2.26

/**
 * SECTION:gboxed
 * @short_description: A mechanism to wrap opaque C structures registered
 *     by the type system
 * @see_also: #GParamSpecBoxed, g_param_spec_boxed()
 * @title: Boxed Types
 *
 * #GBoxed is a generic wrapper mechanism for arbitrary C structures. The only
 * thing the type system needs to know about the structures is how to copy them
 * (a #GBoxedCopyFunc) and how to free them (a #GBoxedFreeFunc) — beyond that
 * they are treated as opaque chunks of memory.
 *
 * Boxed types are useful for simple value-holder structures like rectangles or
 * points. They can also be used for wrapping structures defined in non-#GObject
 * based libraries. They allow arbitrary structures to be handled in a uniform
 * way, allowing uniform copying (or referencing) and freeing (or unreferencing)
 * of them, and uniform representation of the type of the contained structure.
 * In turn, this allows any type which can be boxed to be set as the data in a
 * #GValue, which allows for polymorphic handling of a much wider range of data
 * types, and hence usage of such types as #GObject property values.
 *
 * #GBoxed is designed so that reference counted types can be boxed. Use the
 * type’s ‘ref’ function as the #GBoxedCopyFunc, and its ‘unref’ function as the
 * #GBoxedFreeFunc. For example, for #GBytes, the #GBoxedCopyFunc is
 * g_bytes_ref(), and the #GBoxedFreeFunc is g_bytes_unref().

/**
 * SECTION:gclosure
 * @short_description: Functions as first-class objects
 * @title: Closures
 *
 * A #GClosure represents a callback supplied by the programmer. It
 * will generally comprise a function of some kind and a marshaller
 * used to call it. It is the responsibility of the marshaller to
 * convert the arguments for the invocation from #GValues into
 * a suitable form, perform the callback on the converted arguments,
 * and transform the return value back into a #GValue.
 *
 * In the case of C programs, a closure usually just holds a pointer
 * to a function and maybe a data argument, and the marshaller
 * converts between #GValue and native C types. The GObject
 * library provides the #GCClosure type for this purpose. Bindings for
 * other languages need marshallers which convert between #GValues
 * and suitable representations in the runtime of the language in
 * order to use functions written in that language as callbacks. Use
 * g_closure_set_marshal() to set the marshaller on such a custom
 * closure implementation.
 *
 * Within GObject, closures play an important role in the
 * implementation of signals. When a signal is registered, the
 * @c_marshaller argument to g_signal_new() specifies the default C
 * marshaller for any closure which is connected to this
 * signal. GObject provides a number of C marshallers for this
 * purpose, see the g_cclosure_marshal_*() functions. Additional C
 * marshallers can be generated with the [glib-genmarshal][glib-genmarshal]
 * utility.  Closures can be explicitly connected to signals with
 * g_signal_connect_closure(), but it usually more convenient to let
 * GObject create a closure automatically by using one of the
 * g_signal_connect_*() functions which take a callback function/user
 * data pair.
 *
 * Using closures has a number of important advantages over a simple
 * callback function/data pointer combination:
 *
 * - Closures allow the callee to get the types of the callback parameters,
 *   which means that language bindings don't have to write individual glue
 *   for each callback type.
 *
 * - The reference counting of #GClosure makes it easy to handle reentrancy
 *   right; if a callback is removed while it is being invoked, the closure
 *   and its parameters won't be freed until the invocation finishes.
 *
 * - g_closure_invalidate() and invalidation notifiers allow callbacks to be
 *   automatically removed when the objects they point to go away.

/**
 * SECTION:gtype
 * @short_description: The GLib Runtime type identification and
 *     management system
 * @title: Type Information
 *
 * The GType API is the foundation of the GObject system.  It provides the
 * facilities for registering and managing all fundamental data types,
 * user-defined object and interface types.
 *
 * For type creation and registration purposes, all types fall into one of
 * two categories: static or dynamic.  Static types are never loaded or
 * unloaded at run-time as dynamic types may be.  Static types are created
 * with g_type_register_static() that gets type specific information passed
 * in via a #GTypeInfo structure.
 *
 * Dynamic types are created with g_type_register_dynamic() which takes a
 * #GTypePlugin structure instead. The remaining type information (the
 * #GTypeInfo structure) is retrieved during runtime through #GTypePlugin
 * and the g_type_plugin_*() API.
 *
 * These registration functions are usually called only once from a
 * function whose only purpose is to return the type identifier for a
 * specific class.  Once the type (or class or interface) is registered,
 * it may be instantiated, inherited, or implemented depending on exactly
 * what sort of type it is.
 *
 * There is also a third registration function for registering fundamental
 * types called g_type_register_fundamental() which requires both a #GTypeInfo
 * structure and a #GTypeFundamentalInfo structure but it is seldom used
 * since most fundamental types are predefined rather than user-defined.
 *
 * Type instance and class structs are limited to a total of 64 KiB,
 * including all parent types. Similarly, type instances' private data
 * (as created by G_ADD_PRIVATE()) are limited to a total of
 * 64 KiB. If a type instance needs a large static buffer, allocate it
 * separately (typically by using #GArray or #GPtrArray) and put a pointer
 * to the buffer in the structure.
 *
 * As mentioned in the [GType conventions][gtype-conventions], type names must
 * be at least three characters long. There is no upper length limit. The first
 * character must be a letter (a–z or A–Z) or an underscore (‘_’). Subsequent
 * characters can be letters, numbers or any of ‘-_+’.

/**
 * SECTION:gtypemodule
 * @short_description: Type loading modules
 * @see_also: #GTypePlugin, #GModule
 * @title: GTypeModule
 *
 * #GTypeModule provides a simple implementation of the #GTypePlugin
 * interface. The model of #GTypeModule is a dynamically loaded module
 * which implements some number of types and interface implementations.
 * When the module is loaded, it registers its types and interfaces
 * using g_type_module_register_type() and g_type_module_add_interface().
 * As long as any instances of these types and interface implementations
 * are in use, the module is kept loaded. When the types and interfaces
 * are gone, the module may be unloaded. If the types and interfaces
 * become used again, the module will be reloaded. Note that the last
 * unref cannot happen in module code, since that would lead to the
 * caller's code being unloaded before g_object_unref() returns to it.
 *
 * Keeping track of whether the module should be loaded or not is done by
 * using a use count - it starts at zero, and whenever it is greater than
 * zero, the module is loaded. The use count is maintained internally by
 * the type system, but also can be explicitly controlled by
 * g_type_module_use() and g_type_module_unuse(). Typically, when loading
 * a module for the first type, g_type_module_use() will be used to load
 * it so that it can initialize its types. At some later point, when the
 * module no longer needs to be loaded except for the type
 * implementations it contains, g_type_module_unuse() is called.
 *
 * #GTypeModule does not actually provide any implementation of module
 * loading and unloading. To create a particular module type you must
 * derive from #GTypeModule and implement the load and unload functions
 * in #GTypeModuleClass.
 */


/**
 * SECTION:gtypeplugin
 * @short_description: An interface for dynamically loadable types
 * @see_also: #GTypeModule and g_type_register_dynamic().
 * @title: GTypePlugin
 *
 * The GObject type system supports dynamic loading of types.
 * The #GTypePlugin interface is used to handle the lifecycle
 * of dynamically loaded types. It goes as follows:
 *
 * 1. The type is initially introduced (usually upon loading the module
 *    the first time, or by your main application that knows what modules
 *    introduces what types), like this:
 *    |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *    new_type_id = g_type_register_dynamic (parent_type_id,
 *                                           "TypeName",
 *                                           new_type_plugin,
 *                                           type_flags);
 *    ]|
 *    where @new_type_plugin is an implementation of the
 *    #GTypePlugin interface.
 *
 * 2. The type's implementation is referenced, e.g. through
 *    g_type_class_ref() or through g_type_create_instance() (this is
 *    being called by g_object_new()) or through one of the above done on
 *    a type derived from @new_type_id.
 *
 * 3. This causes the type system to load the type's implementation by
 *    calling g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info()
 *    on @new_type_plugin.
 *
 * 4. At some point the type's implementation isn't required anymore,
 *    e.g. after g_type_class_unref() or g_type_free_instance() (called
 *    when the reference count of an instance drops to zero).
 *
 * 5. This causes the type system to throw away the information retrieved
 *    from g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() and then it calls
 *    g_type_plugin_unuse() on @new_type_plugin.
 *
 * 6. Things may repeat from the second step.
 *
 * So basically, you need to implement a #GTypePlugin type that
 * carries a use_count, once use_count goes from zero to one, you need
 * to load the implementation to successfully handle the upcoming
 * g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() call. Later, maybe after
 * succeeding use/unuse calls, once use_count drops to zero, you can
 * unload the implementation again. The type system makes sure to call
 * g_type_plugin_use() and g_type_plugin_complete_type_info() again
 * when the type is needed again.
 *
 * #GTypeModule is an implementation of #GTypePlugin that already
 * implements most of this except for the actual module loading and
 * unloading. It even handles multiple registered types per module.

/**
 * SECTION:objects
 * @title: GObject
 * @short_description: The base object type
 * @see_also: #GParamSpecObject, g_param_spec_object()
 *
 * GObject is the fundamental type providing the common attributes and
 * methods for all object types in GTK+, Pango and other libraries
 * based on GObject.  The GObject class provides methods for object
 * construction and destruction, property access methods, and signal
 * support.  Signals are described in detail [here][gobject-Signals].
 *
 * For a tutorial on implementing a new GObject class, see [How to define and
 * implement a new GObject][howto-gobject]. For a list of naming conventions for
 * GObjects and their methods, see the [GType conventions][gtype-conventions].
 * For the high-level concepts behind GObject, read [Instantiable classed types:
 * Objects][gtype-instantiable-classed].
 *
 * ## Floating references # {#floating-ref}
 *
 * **Note**: Floating references are a C convenience API and should not be
 * used in modern GObject code. Language bindings in particular find the
 * concept highly problematic, as floating references are not identifiable
 * through annotations, and neither are deviations from the floating reference
 * behavior, like types that inherit from #GInitiallyUnowned and still return
 * a full reference from g_object_new().
 *
 * GInitiallyUnowned is derived from GObject. The only difference between
 * the two is that the initial reference of a GInitiallyUnowned is flagged
 * as a "floating" reference. This means that it is not specifically
 * claimed to be "owned" by any code portion. The main motivation for
 * providing floating references is C convenience. In particular, it
 * allows code to be written as:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * container = create_container ();
 * container_add_child (container, create_child());
 * ]|
 * If container_add_child() calls g_object_ref_sink() on the passed-in child,
 * no reference of the newly created child is leaked. Without floating
 * references, container_add_child() can only g_object_ref() the new child,
 * so to implement this code without reference leaks, it would have to be
 * written as:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * Child *child;
 * container = create_container ();
 * child = create_child ();
 * container_add_child (container, child);
 * g_object_unref (child);
 * ]|
 * The floating reference can be converted into an ordinary reference by
 * calling g_object_ref_sink(). For already sunken objects (objects that
 * don't have a floating reference anymore), g_object_ref_sink() is equivalent
 * to g_object_ref() and returns a new reference.
 *
 * Since floating references are useful almost exclusively for C convenience,
 * language bindings that provide automated reference and memory ownership
 * maintenance (such as smart pointers or garbage collection) should not
 * expose floating references in their API. The best practice for handling
 * types that have initially floating references is to immediately sink those
 * references after g_object_new() returns, by checking if the #GType
 * inherits from #GInitiallyUnowned. For instance:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GObject *res = g_object_new_with_properties (gtype,
 *                                              n_props,
 *                                              prop_names,

/**
 * SECTION:signals
 * @short_description: A means for customization of object behaviour
 *     and a general purpose notification mechanism
 * @title: Signals
 *
 * The basic concept of the signal system is that of the emission
 * of a signal. Signals are introduced per-type and are identified
 * through strings. Signals introduced for a parent type are available
 * in derived types as well, so basically they are a per-type facility
 * that is inherited.
 *
 * A signal emission mainly involves invocation of a certain set of
 * callbacks in precisely defined manner. There are two main categories
 * of such callbacks, per-object ones and user provided ones.
 * (Although signals can deal with any kind of instantiatable type, I'm
 * referring to those types as "object types" in the following, simply
 * because that is the context most users will encounter signals in.)
 * The per-object callbacks are most often referred to as "object method
 * handler" or "default (signal) handler", while user provided callbacks are
 * usually just called "signal handler".
 *
 * The object method handler is provided at signal creation time (this most
 * frequently happens at the end of an object class' creation), while user
 * provided handlers are frequently connected and disconnected to/from a
 * certain signal on certain object instances.
 *
 * A signal emission consists of five stages, unless prematurely stopped:
 *
 * 1. Invocation of the object method handler for %G_SIGNAL_RUN_FIRST signals
 *
 * 2. Invocation of normal user-provided signal handlers (where the @after
 *    flag is not set)
 *
 * 3. Invocation of the object method handler for %G_SIGNAL_RUN_LAST signals
 *
 * 4. Invocation of user provided signal handlers (where the @after flag is set)
 *
 * 5. Invocation of the object method handler for %G_SIGNAL_RUN_CLEANUP signals
 *
 * The user-provided signal handlers are called in the order they were
 * connected in.
 *
 * All handlers may prematurely stop a signal emission, and any number of
 * handlers may be connected, disconnected, blocked or unblocked during
 * a signal emission.
 *
 * There are certain criteria for skipping user handlers in stages 2 and 4
 * of a signal emission.
 *
 * First, user handlers may be blocked. Blocked handlers are omitted during
 * callback invocation, to return from the blocked state, a handler has to
 * get unblocked exactly the same amount of times it has been blocked before.
 *
 * Second, upon emission of a %G_SIGNAL_DETAILED signal, an additional
 * @detail argument passed in to g_signal_emit() has to match the detail
 * argument of the signal handler currently subject to invocation.
 * Specification of no detail argument for signal handlers (omission of the
 * detail part of the signal specification upon connection) serves as a
 * wildcard and matches any detail argument passed in to emission.
 *
 * While the @detail argument is typically used to pass an object property name
 * (as with #GObject::notify), no specific format is mandated for the detail
 * string, other than that it must be non-empty.
 *
 * ## Memory management of signal handlers # {#signal-memory-management}
 *
 * If you are connecting handlers to signals and using a #GObject instance as
 * your signal handler user data, you should remember to pair calls to
 * g_signal_connect() with calls to g_signal_handler_disconnect() or
 * g_signal_handlers_disconnect_by_func(). While signal handlers are
 * automatically disconnected when the object emitting the signal is finalised,
 * they are not automatically disconnected when the signal handler user data is
 * destroyed. If this user data is a #GObject instance, using it from a
 * signal handler after it has been finalised is an error.
 *
 * There are two strategies for managing such user data. The first is to
 * disconnect the signal handler (using g_signal_handler_disconnect() or
 * g_signal_handlers_disconnect_by_func()) when the user data (object) is
 * finalised; this has to be implemented manually. For non-threaded programs,
 * g_signal_connect_object() can be used to implement this automatically.
 * Currently, however, it is unsafe to use in threaded programs.
 *
 * The second is to hold a strong reference on the user data until after the
 * signal is disconnected for other reasons. This can be implemented
 * automatically using g_signal_connect_data().
 *
 * The first approach is recommended, as the second approach can result in
 * effective memory leaks of the user data if the signal handler is never
 * disconnected for some reason.

 * SECTION:value_arrays
 * @short_description: A container structure to maintain an array of
 *     generic values
 * @see_also: #GValue, #GParamSpecValueArray, g_param_spec_value_array()
 * @title: Value arrays
 *
 * The prime purpose of a #GValueArray is for it to be used as an
 * object property that holds an array of values. A #GValueArray wraps
 * an array of #GValue elements in order for it to be used as a boxed
 * type through %G_TYPE_VALUE_ARRAY.
 *
 * #GValueArray is deprecated in favour of #GArray since GLib 2.32. It
 * is possible to create a #GArray that behaves like a #GValueArray by
 * using the size of #GValue as the element size, and by setting
 * g_value_unset() as the clear function using g_array_set_clear_func(),
 * for instance, the following code:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GValueArray *array = g_value_array_new (10);
 * ]|
 *
 * can be replaced by:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   GArray *array = g_array_sized_new (FALSE, TRUE, sizeof (GValue), 10);
 *   g_array_set_clear_func (array, (GDestroyNotify) g_value_unset);
 * ]|
 *
 * Deprecated: 2.32: Use #GArray instead, if possible for the given use case,
 *    as described above.

 * to see if the object is still floating, and if so, unsets the
 * floating state and decreases the reference count. If the closure
 * is not floating, g_closure_sink() does nothing. The reason for the
 * existence of the floating state is to prevent cumbersome code
 * sequences like:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * closure = g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data);
 * g_source_set_closure (source, closure);
 * g_closure_unref (closure); // GObject doesn't really need this
 * ]|
 * Because g_source_set_closure() (and similar functions) take ownership of the
 * initial reference count, if it is unowned, we instead can write:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * g_source_set_closure (source, g_cclosure_new (cb_func, cb_data));
 * ]|
 *
 * Generally, this function is used together with g_closure_ref(). An example
 * of storing a closure for later notification looks like:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * static GClosure *notify_closure = NULL;
 * void
 * foo_notify_set_closure (GClosure *closure)
 * {
 *   if (notify_closure)
 *     g_closure_unref (notify_closure);
 *   notify_closure = closure;
 *   if (notify_closure)
 *     {
 *       g_closure_ref (notify_closure);
 *       g_closure_sink (notify_closure);
 *     }
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Because g_closure_sink() may decrement the reference count of a closure
 * (if it hasn't been called on @closure yet) just like g_closure_unref(),
 * g_closure_ref() should be called prior to this function.

 *
 * Increases the reference count of the object by one and sets a

 * dropped, or when this is already the last reference to the object
 * and another reference is established.
 *
 * This functionality is intended for binding @object to a proxy
 * object managed by another memory manager. This is done with two
 * paired references: the strong reference added by
 * g_object_add_toggle_ref() and a reverse reference to the proxy
 * object which is either a strong reference or weak reference.
 *
 * The setup is that when there are no other references to @object,
 * only a weak reference is held in the reverse direction from @object
 * to the proxy object, but when there are other references held to
 * @object, a strong reference is held. The @notify callback is called
 * when the reference from @object to the proxy object should be
 * "toggled" from strong to weak (@is_last_ref true) or weak to strong
 * (@is_last_ref false).
 *
 * Since a (normal) reference must be held to the object before
 * calling g_object_add_toggle_ref(), the initial state of the reverse
 * link is always strong.
 *
 * Multiple toggle references may be added to the same gobject,
 * however if there are multiple toggle references to an object, none
