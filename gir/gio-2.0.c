 *
 * You can add options to be recognised during commandline option
 * parsing using g_application_add_main_option_entries() and
 * g_application_add_option_group().
 *
 * Signal handlers can inspect @options (along with values pointed to
 * from the @arg_data of an installed #GOptionEntrys) in order to
 * decide to perform certain actions, including direct local handling
 * (which may be useful for options like --version).
 *
 * In the event that the application is marked
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE the "normal processing" will
 * send the @options dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
 * read with g_application_command_line_get_options_dict().  The signal
 * handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
 * modified dictionary will be sent.
 *
 * In the event that %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is not set,
 * "normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
 * line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
 * the application is activated by g_application_activate().  One or
 * more arguments results in a call to g_application_open().
 *
 * If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
 * by converting them to calls to g_application_open() or
 * g_action_group_activate_action() then you must be sure to register
 * the application first.  You should probably not call
 * g_application_activate() for yourself, however: just return -1 and
 * allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
 * the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
 * in that case).
 *
 * Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
 * local_command_line().  If you override that function and don't
 * chain up then this signal will never be emitted.
 *
 * You can override local_command_line() if you need more powerful
 * capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not
 * normally be required.
 *
 * Returns: an exit code. If you have handled your options and want
 * to exit the process, return a non-negative option, 0 for success,
 * and a positive value for failure. To continue, return -1 to let
 * the default option processing continue.

/**
 * GCancellable::cancelled:
 * @cancellable: a #GCancellable.
 *
 * Emitted when the operation has been cancelled.
 *
 * Can be used by implementations of cancellable operations. If the
 * operation is cancelled from another thread, the signal will be
 * emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the
 * thread that is running the operation.
 *
 * Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a
 * multi-threaded program is prone to race conditions. For instance
 * it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even after
 * a call to g_signal_handler_disconnect() for that handler has
 * already returned.
 *
 * There is also a problem when cancellation happens right before
 * connecting to the signal. If this happens the signal will
 * unexpectedly not be emitted, and checking before connecting to
 * the signal leaves a race condition where this is still happening.
 *
 * In order to make it safe and easy to connect handlers there
 * are two helper functions: g_cancellable_connect() and
 * g_cancellable_disconnect() which protect against problems
 * like this.
 *
 * An example of how to us this:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *     // Make sure we don't do unnecessary work if already cancelled
 *     if (g_cancellable_set_error_if_cancelled (cancellable, error))
 *       return;
 *
 *     // Set up all the data needed to be able to handle cancellation
 *     // of the operation
 *     my_data = my_data_new (...);
 *
 *     id = 0;
 *     if (cancellable)
 *       id = g_cancellable_connect (cancellable,
 *     			      G_CALLBACK (cancelled_handler)
 *     			      data, NULL);
 *
 *     // cancellable operation here...
 *
 *     g_cancellable_disconnect (cancellable, id);
 *
 *     // cancelled_handler is never called after this, it is now safe
 *     // to free the data
 *     my_data_free (my_data);
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that the cancelled signal is emitted in the thread that
 * the user cancelled from, which may be the main thread. So, the
 * cancellable signal should not do something that can block.

/**
 * SECTION:extensionpoints
 * @short_description: Extension Points
 * @include: gio.h
 * @see_also: [Extending GIO][extending-gio]
 *
 * #GIOExtensionPoint provides a mechanism for modules to extend the
 * functionality of the library or application that loaded it in an
 * organized fashion.
 *
 * An extension point is identified by a name, and it may optionally
 * require that any implementation must be of a certain type (or derived
 * thereof). Use g_io_extension_point_register() to register an
 * extension point, and g_io_extension_point_set_required_type() to
 * set a required type.
 *
 * A module can implement an extension point by specifying the #GType
 * that implements the functionality. Additionally, each implementation
 * of an extension point has a name, and a priority. Use
 * g_io_extension_point_implement() to implement an extension point.
 *
 *  |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *  GIOExtensionPoint *ep;
 *
 *  // Register an extension point
 *  ep = g_io_extension_point_register ("my-extension-point");
 *  g_io_extension_point_set_required_type (ep, MY_TYPE_EXAMPLE);
 *  ]|
 *
 *  |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *  // Implement an extension point
 *  G_DEFINE_TYPE (MyExampleImpl, my_example_impl, MY_TYPE_EXAMPLE)
 *  g_io_extension_point_implement ("my-extension-point",
 *                                  my_example_impl_get_type (),
 *                                  "my-example",
 *                                  10);
 *  ]|
 *
 *  It is up to the code that registered the extension point how
 *  it uses the implementations that have been associated with it.
 *  Depending on the use case, it may use all implementations, or
 *  only the one with the highest priority, or pick a specific
 *  one by name.
 *
 *  To avoid opening all modules just to find out what extension
 *  points they implement, GIO makes use of a caching mechanism,
 *  see [gio-querymodules][gio-querymodules].
 *  You are expected to run this command after installing a
 *  GIO module.
 *
 *  The `GIO_EXTRA_MODULES` environment variable can be used to
 *  specify additional directories to automatically load modules
 *  from. This environment variable has the same syntax as the
 *  `PATH`. If two modules have the same base name in different
 *  directories, then the latter one will be ignored. If additional
 *  directories are specified GIO will load modules from the built-in
 *  directory last.

/**
 * SECTION:gaction
 * @title: GAction
 * @short_description: An action interface
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GAction represents a single named action.
 *
 * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
 * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
 * emitted.  An activation has a #GVariant parameter (which may be
 * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
 * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
 * set with g_action_change_state().  This call takes a #GVariant.  The
 * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
 * (which is given at construction time).
 *
 * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
 * range.
 *
 * #GAction is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
 * described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
 * #GSimpleAction.
 *
 * In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
 * name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the
 * optional state type and the state and emitting the appropriate
 * signals when these change.  The implementor is responsible for filtering
 * calls to g_action_activate() and g_action_change_state() for type
 * safety and for the state being enabled.
 *
 * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #GAction is to put it
 * inside of a #GSimpleActionGroup.
 */


/**
 * SECTION:gactiongroup
 * @title: GActionGroup
 * @short_description: A group of actions
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GAction
 *
 * #GActionGroup represents a group of actions. Actions can be used to
 * expose functionality in a structured way, either from one part of a
 * program to another, or to the outside world. Action groups are often
 * used together with a #GMenuModel that provides additional
 * representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in
 * a menu.
 *
 * The main way to interact with the actions in a GActionGroup is to
 * activate them with g_action_group_activate_action(). Activating an
 * action may require a #GVariant parameter. The required type of the
 * parameter can be inquired with g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type().
 * Actions may be disabled, see g_action_group_get_action_enabled().
 * Activating a disabled action has no effect.
 *
 * Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The
 * current state of an action can be inquired with
 * g_action_group_get_action_state(). Activating a stateful action may
 * change its state, but it is also possible to set the state by calling
 * g_action_group_change_action_state().
 *
 * As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
 * option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
 * this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
 * action would toggle the state.
 *
 * Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
 * method calls, except g_action_group_list_actions() take the name of
 * an action as an argument.
 *
 * The #GActionGroup API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
 * group.  The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
 * forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
 * with actions.  'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
 * the action group implementation) are found on subclasses.  This is
 * why you will find - for example - g_action_group_get_action_enabled()
 * but not an equivalent set() call.
 *
 * Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
 * on individual actions.
 *
 * Implementations of #GActionGroup should provide implementations for
 * the virtual functions g_action_group_list_actions() and
 * g_action_group_query_action().  The other virtual functions should
 * not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with
 * calls to g_action_group_query_action().

/**
 * SECTION:gappinfo
 * @short_description: Application information and launch contexts
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GAppInfoMonitor
 *
 * #GAppInfo and #GAppLaunchContext are used for describing and launching
 * applications installed on the system.
 *
 * As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
 * (using g_file_get_path()) when using g_app_info_launch() even if
 * the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
 * for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
 * %U` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
 * only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
 * compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
 * is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
 * Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
 * path (in gvfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
 * passed unmodified to the application.
 *
 * Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
 * back to the GIO URI in the #GFile constructors (since gvfs
 * implements the #GVfs extension point). As such, if the application
 * needs to examine the URI, it needs to use g_file_get_uri() or
 * similar on #GFile. In other words, an application cannot assume
 * that the URI passed to e.g. g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() is
 * equal to the result of g_file_get_uri(). The following snippet
 * illustrates this:
 *
 * |[
 * GFile *f;
 * char *uri;
 *
 * file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);
 *
 * uri = g_file_get_uri (file);
 * strcmp (uri, uri_from_commandline) == 0;
 * g_free (uri);
 *
 * if (g_file_has_uri_scheme (file, "cdda"))
 *   {
 *     // do something special with uri
 *   }
 * g_object_unref (file);
 * ]|
 *
 * This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
 * application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
 * for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
 * Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have
 * different ideas of what a given URI means.

/**
 * SECTION:gapplication
 * @title: GApplication
 * @short_description: Core application class
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 *
 * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
 * a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
 * be changed using g_application_hold() and g_application_release(). If
 * it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
 * #GtkApplication employ the use count to ensure that the application
 * stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
 *
 * Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
 * uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
 * providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
 * with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
 * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
 * desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
 * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
 * running program. The already running instance of the program is
 * called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
 * the always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
 * is used for communication.
 *
 * The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used
 * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
 * application is not expected to manually register itself and check
 * if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
 * #GApplication should do very little more than instantiating the
 * application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
 * calling g_application_run(). All checks for uniqueness are done
 * internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
 * startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
 * is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
 * instance and g_application_run() promptly returns. See the code
 * examples below.
 *
 * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the same as
 * that of of a
 * [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
 * Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
 * `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
 *
 * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
 * on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
 * application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
 * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
 * object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
 * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
 * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
 * (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
 * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
 * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
 * g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
 * g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if you want to register object paths.
 *
 * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap
 * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
 * g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking an action by calling
 * g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it is always
 * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
 * the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
 * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
 * for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.
 *
 * There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
 *
 * - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
 *
 * - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
 *
 * - by handling a command-line
 *
 * - via activating an action
 *
 * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 *
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
 * application, GApplication passes some "platform data from the
 * launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
 * #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
 * data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual functions
 * in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
 * #GApplicationCommandLine objects, the platform data is
 * directly available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
 * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
 * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
 *
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * %G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set. #GApplication subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
 * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
 * data in this way.
 *
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
 * vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
 * respectively.

 * SECTION:gapplicationcommandline
 * @title: GApplicationCommandLine
 * @short_description: A command-line invocation of an application
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GApplication
 *
 * #GApplicationCommandLine represents a command-line invocation of
 * an application.  It is created by #GApplication and emitted
 * in the #GApplication::command-line signal and virtual function.
 *
 * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
 * with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
 * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
 * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
 * commandline to this process).
 *
 * The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the @argc and @argv
 * parameters for use with the #GOptionContext command-line parsing API,
 * with the g_application_command_line_get_arguments() function. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
 * for an example.
 *
 * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
 * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
 * lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
 * of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
 * dropped).
 *
 * The main use for #GApplicationCommandLine (and the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
 * You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
 * your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
 * have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
 * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
 * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
 * does not return until the editing is done.
 *
 * Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
 * #GApplication::command-line handler. The launching instance exits
 * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
 * the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
 * of the launching instance.

/**
 * SECTION:gasyncresult
 * @short_description: Asynchronous Function Results
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GTask
 *
 * Provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
 *
 * Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations
 * which are chained together by a #GAsyncReadyCallback. To begin
 * an asynchronous operation, provide a #GAsyncReadyCallback to the
 * asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered when the
 * operation has completed, and must be run in a later iteration of
 * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * from where the operation was initiated. It will be passed a
 * #GAsyncResult instance filled with the details of the operation's
 * success or failure, the object the asynchronous function was
 * started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous callback
 * function is then expected to call the corresponding "_finish()"
 * function, passing the object the function was called for, the
 * #GAsyncResult instance, and (optionally) an @error to grab any
 * error conditions that may have occurred.
 *
 * The "_finish()" function for an operation takes the generic result
 * (of type #GAsyncResult) and returns the specific result that the
 * operation in question yields (e.g. a #GFileEnumerator for a
 * "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the
 * operation is not needed, there is no need to call the "_finish()"
 * function; GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error
 * information after the #GAsyncReadyCallback returns. You can pass
 * %NULL for the #GAsyncReadyCallback if you don't need to take any
 * action at all after the operation completes. Applications may also
 * take a reference to the #GAsyncResult and call "_finish()" later;
 * however, the "_finish()" function may be called at most once.
 *
 * Example of a typical asynchronous operation flow:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * void _theoretical_frobnitz_async (Theoretical         *t,
 *                                   GCancellable        *c,

 * gboolean _theoretical_frobnitz_finish (Theoretical   *t,
 *                                        GAsyncResult  *res,
 *                                        GError       **e);

 *
 * The callback for an asynchronous operation is called only once, and is
 * always called, even in the case of a cancelled operation. On cancellation
 * the result is a %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED error.
 *
 * ## I/O Priority # {#io-priority}
 *
 * Many I/O-related asynchronous operations have a priority parameter,
 * which is used in certain cases to determine the order in which
 * operations are executed. They are not used to determine system-wide
 * I/O scheduling. Priorities are integers, with lower numbers indicating
 * higher priority. It is recommended to choose priorities between
 * %G_PRIORITY_LOW and %G_PRIORITY_HIGH, with %G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT

 * @short_description: Low-level datagram communications interface
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GSocket, [<gnetworking.h>][gio-gnetworking.h]
 *
 * A #GDatagramBased is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
 * communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
 * BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
 * #GSocket, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
 *
 * #GDatagramBased is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
 * alongside higher-level networking APIs such as #GIOStream.
 *
 * It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
 * to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
 * the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
 * or system calls. For example, #GSocket uses recvmmsg() and sendmmsg() where
 * possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
 * multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
 * assemble or disassemble a message.
 *
 * Each #GDatagramBased operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
 * for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
 * timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
 * error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
 * %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
 * will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
 * timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
 * %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would
 * successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or
 * g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use
 * g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a #GMainContext to get
 * callbacks when I/O is possible.
 *
 * When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
 * said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
 * condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
 * instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
 * returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 *
 * As with #GSocket, #GDatagramBaseds can be either connection oriented (for
 * example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). #GDatagramBaseds must be
 * datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
 * establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
 * before sending and receiving data through the #GDatagramBased API. For
 * connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
 * received in each I/O operation.
 *
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GDatagramBased is not inherently thread safe.
 * To use a #GDatagramBased concurrently from multiple threads, you must
 * implement your own locking.

 *
 * By default, a #GDBusServer or server-side #GDBusConnection will allow

/**
 * SECTION:gdbusconnection
 * @short_description: D-Bus Connections
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * The #GDBusConnection type is used for D-Bus connections to remote
 * peers such as a message buses. It is a low-level API that offers a
 * lot of flexibility. For instance, it lets you establish a connection
 * over any transport that can by represented as a #GIOStream.
 *
 * This class is rarely used directly in D-Bus clients. If you are writing
 * a D-Bus client, it is often easier to use the g_bus_own_name(),
 * g_bus_watch_name() or g_dbus_proxy_new_for_bus() APIs.
 *
 * As an exception to the usual GLib rule that a particular object must not
 * be used by two threads at the same time, #GDBusConnection's methods may be
 * called from any thread. This is so that g_bus_get() and g_bus_get_sync()
 * can safely return the same #GDBusConnection when called from any thread.
 *
 * Most of the ways to obtain a #GDBusConnection automatically initialize it
 * (i.e. connect to D-Bus): for instance, g_dbus_connection_new() and
 * g_bus_get(), and the synchronous versions of those methods, give you an
 * initialized connection. Language bindings for GIO should use
 * g_initable_new() or g_async_initable_new_async(), which also initialize the
 * connection.
 *
 * If you construct an uninitialized #GDBusConnection, such as via
 * g_object_new(), you must initialize it via g_initable_init() or
 * g_async_initable_init_async() before using its methods or properties.
 * Calling methods or accessing properties on a #GDBusConnection that has not
 * completed initialization successfully is considered to be invalid, and leads
 * to undefined behaviour. In particular, if initialization fails with a
 * #GError, the only valid thing you can do with that #GDBusConnection is to
 * free it with g_object_unref().

/**
 * SECTION:gdbuserror
 * @title: GDBusError
 * @short_description: Mapping D-Bus errors to and from GError
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * All facilities that return errors from remote methods (such as
 * g_dbus_connection_call_sync()) use #GError to represent both D-Bus
 * errors (e.g. errors returned from the other peer) and locally
 * in-process generated errors.
 *
 * To check if a returned #GError is an error from a remote peer, use
 * g_dbus_error_is_remote_error(). To get the actual D-Bus error name,
 * use g_dbus_error_get_remote_error(). Before presenting an error,
 * always use g_dbus_error_strip_remote_error().
 *
 * In addition, facilities used to return errors to a remote peer also
 * use #GError. See g_dbus_method_invocation_return_error() for
 * discussion about how the D-Bus error name is set.
 *
 * Applications can associate a #GError error domain with a set of D-Bus errors in order to
 * automatically map from D-Bus errors to #GError and back. This
 * is typically done in the function returning the #GQuark for the
 * error domain:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->

 * ]|
 * With this setup, a D-Bus peer can transparently pass e.g. %FOO_BAR_ERROR_ANOTHER_ERROR and
 * other peers will see the D-Bus error name org.project.Foo.Bar.Error.AnotherError.
 *
 * If the other peer is using GDBus, and has registered the association with
 * g_dbus_error_register_error_domain() in advance (e.g. by invoking the %FOO_BAR_ERROR quark
 * generation itself in the previous example) the peer will see also %FOO_BAR_ERROR_ANOTHER_ERROR instead
 * of %G_IO_ERROR_DBUS_ERROR. Note that GDBus clients can still recover
 * org.project.Foo.Bar.Error.AnotherError using g_dbus_error_get_remote_error().
 *
 * Note that the %G_DBUS_ERROR error domain is intended only
 * for returning errors from a remote message bus process. Errors

 * code implementing the
 * [org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#standard-interfaces-objectmanager)
 * interface).
 *
 * Once an instance of this type has been created, you can connect to
 * the #GDBusObjectManager::object-added and
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-removed signals and inspect the
 * #GDBusObjectProxy objects returned by
 * g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects().
 *
 * If the name for a #GDBusObjectManagerClient is not owned by anyone at
 * object construction time, the default behavior is to request the
 * message bus to launch an owner for the name. This behavior can be
 * disabled using the %G_DBUS_OBJECT_MANAGER_CLIENT_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START
 * flag. It's also worth noting that this only works if the name of
 * interest is activatable in the first place. E.g. in some cases it
 * is not possible to launch an owner for the requested name. In this
 * case, #GDBusObjectManagerClient object construction still succeeds but
 * there will be no object proxies
 * (e.g. g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects() returns the empty list) and
 * the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner property is %NULL.
 *
 * The owner of the requested name can come and go (for example
 * consider a system service being restarted) – #GDBusObjectManagerClient
 * handles this case too; simply connect to the #GObject::notify
 * signal to watch for changes on the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
 * property. When the name owner vanishes, the behavior is that
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is set to %NULL (this includes
 * emission of the #GObject::notify signal) and then
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-removed signals are synthesized
 * for all currently existing object proxies. Since
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is %NULL when this happens, you can
 * use this information to disambiguate a synthesized signal from a
 * genuine signal caused by object removal on the remote
 * #GDBusObjectManager. Similarly, when a new name owner appears,
 * #GDBusObjectManager::object-added signals are synthesized
 * while #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is still %NULL. Only when all
 * object proxies have been added, the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
 * is set to the new name owner (this includes emission of the
 * #GObject::notify signal).  Furthermore, you are guaranteed that
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner will alternate between a name owner
 * (e.g. `:1.42`) and %NULL even in the case where
 * the name of interest is atomically replaced
 *
 * Ultimately, #GDBusObjectManagerClient is used to obtain #GDBusProxy
 * instances. All signals (including the
 * org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged signal)
 * delivered to #GDBusProxy instances are guaranteed to originate
 * from the name owner. This guarantee along with the behavior
 * described above, means that certain race conditions including the
 * "half the proxy is from the old owner and the other half is from
 * the new owner" problem cannot happen.
 *
 * To avoid having the application connect to signals on the returned
 * #GDBusObjectProxy and #GDBusProxy objects, the
 * #GDBusObject::interface-added,
 * #GDBusObject::interface-removed,
 * #GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed and

 * are also emitted on the #GDBusObjectManagerClient instance managing these

 * #GDBusObjectManager::interface-added,
 * #GDBusObjectManager::interface-removed,
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-properties-changed and
 * #GDBusObjectManagerClient::interface-proxy-signal.
 *
 * Note that all callbacks and signals are emitted in the

 * that the #GDBusObjectManagerClient object was constructed
 * in. Additionally, the #GDBusObjectProxy and #GDBusProxy objects
 * originating from the #GDBusObjectManagerClient object will be created in

 * By default, #GDBusProxy will cache all properties (and listen to

 * vanishes and reloaded when a name owner appears.
 *
 * The unique name owner of the proxy's name is tracked and can be read from
 * #GDBusProxy:g-name-owner. Connect to the #GObject::notify signal to
 * get notified of changes. Additionally, only signals and property
 * changes emitted from the current name owner are considered and
 * calls are always sent to the current name owner. This avoids a
 * number of race conditions when the name is lost by one owner and
 * claimed by another. However, if no name owner currently exists,
 * then calls will be sent to the well-known name which may result in
 * the message bus launching an owner (unless
 * %G_DBUS_PROXY_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START is set).
 *
 * The generic #GDBusProxy::g-properties-changed and

/**
 * SECTION:gfile
 * @short_description: File and Directory Handling
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GFileInfo, #GFileEnumerator
 *
 * #GFile is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
 * virtual file system. #GFiles are lightweight, immutable objects
 * that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
 * #GFile objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
 * file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
 * (see #GInputStream and #GOutputStream).
 *
 * To construct a #GFile, you can use:
 * - g_file_new_for_path() if you have a path.
 * - g_file_new_for_uri() if you have a URI.
 * - g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() for a command line argument.
 * - g_file_new_tmp() to create a temporary file from a template.
 * - g_file_parse_name() from a UTF-8 string gotten from g_file_get_parse_name().
 * - g_file_new_build_filename() to create a file from path elements.
 *
 * One way to think of a #GFile is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
 * normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
 * #GFiles are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
 * to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
 *
 * #GFiles make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
 * the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
 * #GFile using g_file_get_parent() to get an identifier for the parent
 * directory, g_file_get_child() to get a child within a directory,
 * g_file_resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two
 * #GFiles. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not end up at
 * the same root if you repeatedly call g_file_get_parent() on two different
 * files.
 *
 * All #GFiles have a basename (get with g_file_get_basename()). These names
 * are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
 * (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
 * have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
 * you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
 * name that you can get by requesting the
 * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME attribute with g_file_query_info().
 * This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be used in a user interface.
 * But always store the real basename or the #GFile to use to actually
 * access the file, because there is no way to go from a display name to
 * the actual name.
 *
 * Using #GFile as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
 * in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
 * hard or soft links may cause two different #GFiles to refer to the same
 * file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
 * short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
 * check if two #GFiles point to the same file you can query for the
 * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE attribute. Note that #GFile does some trivial
 * canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
 * the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
 * path, "." or ".." path segments, etc) does not create different #GFiles.
 *
 * Many #GFile operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
 * to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
 * simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous
 * I/O functions call a #GAsyncReadyCallback which is then used to finalize
 * the operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the
 * function's matching _finish() operation.
 *
 * It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
 * shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
 * I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
 * Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
 * [introduction to asynchronous programming section][async-programming] for
 * more.
 *
 * Some #GFile operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
 * so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
 * - g_file_mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file.
 * - g_file_unmount_mountable_with_operation() to unmount a mountable file.
 * - g_file_eject_mountable_with_operation() to eject a mountable file.
 *
 * ## Entity Tags # {#gfile-etag}
 *
 * One notable feature of #GFiles are entity tags, or "etags" for
 * short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
 * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
 * has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
 * HTTP 1.1
 * [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
 * for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.

/**
 * SECTION:gfileattribute
 * @short_description: Key-Value Paired File Attributes
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GFile, #GFileInfo
 *
 * File attributes in GIO consist of a list of key-value pairs.
 *
 * Keys are strings that contain a key namespace and a key name, separated
 * by a colon, e.g. "namespace::keyname". Namespaces are included to sort
 * key-value pairs by namespaces for relevance. Keys can be retrived
 * using wildcards, e.g. "standard::*" will return all of the keys in the
 * "standard" namespace.
 *
 * The list of possible attributes for a filesystem (pointed to by a #GFile) is
 * available as a #GFileAttributeInfoList. This list is queryable by key names
 * as indicated earlier.
 *
 * Information is stored within the list in #GFileAttributeInfo structures.
 * The info structure can store different types, listed in the enum
 * #GFileAttributeType. Upon creation of a #GFileAttributeInfo, the type will
 * be set to %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE_INVALID.
 *
 * Classes that implement #GFileIface will create a #GFileAttributeInfoList and
 * install default keys and values for their given file system, architecture,
 * and other possible implementation details (e.g., on a UNIX system, a file
 * attribute key will be registered for the user id for a given file).
 *
 * ## Default Namespaces
 *
 * - `"standard"`: The "Standard" namespace. General file information that
 *   any application may need should be put in this namespace. Examples
 *   include the file's name, type, and size.
 * - `"etag`: The [Entity Tag][gfile-etag] namespace. Currently, the only key
 *   in this namespace is "value", which contains the value of the current
 *   entity tag.
 * - `"id"`: The "Identification" namespace. This namespace is used by file
 *   managers and applications that list directories to check for loops and
 *   to uniquely identify files.
 * - `"access"`: The "Access" namespace. Used to check if a user has the
 *   proper privileges to access files and perform file operations. Keys in
 *   this namespace are made to be generic and easily understood, e.g. the
 *   "can_read" key is %TRUE if the current user has permission to read the
 *   file. UNIX permissions and NTFS ACLs in Windows should be mapped to
 *   these values.
 * - `"mountable"`: The "Mountable" namespace. Includes simple boolean keys
 *   for checking if a file or path supports mount operations, e.g. mount,
 *   unmount, eject. These are used for files of type %G_FILE_TYPE_MOUNTABLE.
 * - `"time"`: The "Time" namespace. Includes file access, changed, created
 *   times.
 * - `"unix"`: The "Unix" namespace. Includes UNIX-specific information and
 *   may not be available for all files. Examples include the UNIX "UID",
 *   "GID", etc.
 * - `"dos"`: The "DOS" namespace. Includes DOS-specific information and may
 *   not be available for all files. Examples include "is_system" for checking
 *   if a file is marked as a system file, and "is_archive" for checking if a
 *   file is marked as an archive file.
 * - `"owner"`: The "Owner" namespace. Includes information about who owns a
 *   file. May not be available for all file systems. Examples include "user"
 *   for getting the user name of the file owner. This information is often
 *   mapped from some backend specific data such as a UNIX UID.
 * - `"thumbnail"`: The "Thumbnail" namespace. Includes information about file
 *   thumbnails and their location within the file system. Examples of keys in
 *   this namespace include "path" to get the location of a thumbnail, "failed"
 *   to check if thumbnailing of the file failed, and "is-valid" to check if
 *   the thumbnail is outdated.
 * - `"filesystem"`: The "Filesystem" namespace. Gets information about the
 *   file system where a file is located, such as its type, how much space is
 *   left available, and the overall size of the file system.
 * - `"gvfs"`: The "GVFS" namespace. Keys in this namespace contain information
 *   about the current GVFS backend in use.
 * - `"xattr"`: The "xattr" namespace. Gets information about extended
 *   user attributes. See attr(5). The "user." prefix of the extended user
 *   attribute name is stripped away when constructing keys in this namespace,
 *   e.g. "xattr::mime_type" for the extended attribute with the name
 *   "user.mime_type". Note that this information is only available if
 *   GLib has been built with extended attribute support.
 * - `"xattr-sys"`: The "xattr-sys" namespace. Gets information about
 *   extended attributes which are not user-specific. See attr(5). Note
 *   that this information is only available if GLib has been built with
 *   extended attribute support.
 * - `"selinux"`: The "SELinux" namespace. Includes information about the
 *   SELinux context of files. Note that this information is only available
 *   if GLib has been built with SELinux support.
 *
 * Please note that these are not all of the possible namespaces.
 * More namespaces can be added from GIO modules or by individual applications.
 * For more information about writing GIO modules, see #GIOModule.
 *
 * <!-- TODO: Implementation note about using extended attributes on supported
 * file systems -->
 *
 * ## Default Keys
 *
 * For a list of the built-in keys and their types, see the
 * [GFileInfo][GFileInfo] documentation.
 *
 * Note that there are no predefined keys in the "xattr" and "xattr-sys"
 * namespaces. Keys for the "xattr" namespace are constructed by stripping
 * away the "user." prefix from the extended user attribute, and prepending
 * "xattr::". Keys for the "xattr-sys" namespace are constructed by
 * concatenating "xattr-sys::" with the extended attribute name. All extended
 * attribute values are returned as hex-encoded strings in which bytes outside
 * the ASCII range are encoded as escape sequences of the form \x`nn`
 * where `nn` is a 2-digit hexadecimal number.

/**
 * SECTION:giostream
 * @short_description: Base class for implementing read/write streams
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GInputStream, #GOutputStream
 *
 * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 *
 * Examples of #GIOStream objects are #GSocketConnection, which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and #GFileIOStream, which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 *
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
 *
 * The #GIOStream object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the #GIOStream
 * object alive. If the #GIOStream object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 *
 * To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * #GIOStream may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * "half-closed" states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 *
 * Operations on #GIOStreams cannot be started while another operation on the
 * #GIOStream or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the #GInputStream and write to the #GOutputStream simultaneously
 * (either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
 * thread), but an application cannot start any #GIOStream operation while there
 * is a #GIOStream, #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation in progress, and
 * an application can’t start any #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation
 * while there is a #GIOStream operation in progress.
 *
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given #GMainContext (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
 * started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
 * #GMainContext.
 *
 * GIO may run operations on #GIOStreams from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as #GBufferedInputStream or #GTlsConnection. With such wrapper APIs,
 * application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
 * the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
 * not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
 * stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GListStore
 *
 * #GListModel is an interface that represents a mutable list of
 * #GObjects. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets in
 * user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
 * convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
 * updates.
 *
 * Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
 * mechanism (normally the #GObject::notify signal).  Taken together
 * with the #GListModel::items-changed signal, this provides for a list
 * that can change its membership, and in which the members can change
 * their individual properties.
 *
 * A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
 * points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
 * signal strength.
 *
 * It is important to note that the #GListModel itself does not report
 * changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
 * membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
 * then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
 * interested in.
 *
 * All items in a #GListModel are of (or derived from) the same type.
 * g_list_model_get_item_type() returns that type.  The type may be an
 * interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
 *
 * The semantics are close to that of an array:
 * g_list_model_get_n_items() returns the number of items in the list and
 * g_list_model_get_item() returns an item at a (0-based) position. In
 * order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
 * you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
 * g_list_model_get_item() until it returns %NULL.
 *
 * An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
 * return the same object for a given position until all references to
 * it are gone.
 *
 * On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
 * objects that are currently "user visible", in order to faciliate the
 * maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
 * reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
 *
 * This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
 * thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
 * implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
 * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * in effect at the time that the model was created.

/**
 * SECTION:gmenumodel
 * @title: GMenuModel
 * @short_description: An abstract class representing the contents of a menu
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GActionGroup
 *
 * #GMenuModel represents the contents of a menu -- an ordered list of
 * menu items. The items are associated with actions, which can be
 * activated through them. Items can be grouped in sections, and may
 * have submenus associated with them. Both items and sections usually
 * have some representation data, such as labels or icons. The type of
 * the associated action (ie whether it is stateful, and what kind of
 * state it has) can influence the representation of the item.
 *
 * The conceptual model of menus in #GMenuModel is hierarchical:
 * sections and submenus are again represented by #GMenuModels.
 * Menus themselves do not define their own roles. Rather, the role
 * of a particular #GMenuModel is defined by the item that references
 * it (or, in the case of the 'root' menu, is defined by the context
 * in which it is used).
 *
 * As an example, consider the visible portions of this menu:
 *
 * ## An example menu # {#menu-example}
 *
 * ![](menu-example.png)
 *
 * There are 8 "menus" visible in the screenshot: one menubar, two
 * submenus and 5 sections:
 *
 * - the toplevel menubar (containing 4 items)
 * - the View submenu (containing 3 sections)
 * - the first section of the View submenu (containing 2 items)
 * - the second section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the final section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
 * - the Highlight Mode submenu (containing 2 sections)
 * - the Sources section (containing 2 items)
 * - the Markup section (containing 2 items)
 *
 * The [example][menu-model] illustrates the conceptual connection between
 * these 8 menus. Each large block in the figure represents a menu and the
 * smaller blocks within the large block represent items in that menu. Some
 * items contain references to other menus.
 *
 * ## A menu example # {#menu-model}
 *
 * ![](menu-model.png)
 *
 * Notice that the separators visible in the [example][menu-example]
 * appear nowhere in the [menu model][menu-model]. This is because
 * separators are not explicitly represented in the menu model. Instead,
 * a separator is inserted between any two non-empty sections of a menu.
 * Section items can have labels just like any other item. In that case,
 * a display system may show a section header instead of a separator.
 *
 * The motivation for this abstract model of application controls is
 * that modern user interfaces tend to make these controls available
 * outside the application. Examples include global menus, jumplists,
 * dash boards, etc. To support such uses, it is necessary to 'export'
 * information about actions and their representation in menus, which
 * is exactly what the [GActionGroup exporter][gio-GActionGroup-exporter]
 * and the [GMenuModel exporter][gio-GMenuModel-exporter] do for
 * #GActionGroup and #GMenuModel. The client-side counterparts to
 * make use of the exported information are #GDBusActionGroup and
 * #GDBusMenuModel.
 *
 * The API of #GMenuModel is very generic, with iterators for the
 * attributes and links of an item, see g_menu_model_iterate_item_attributes()
 * and g_menu_model_iterate_item_links(). The 'standard' attributes and
 * link types have predefined names: %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL,
 * %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION, %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET, %G_MENU_LINK_SECTION
 * and %G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU.
 *
 * Items in a #GMenuModel represent active controls if they refer to
 * an action that can get activated when the user interacts with the
 * menu item. The reference to the action is encoded by the string id
 * in the %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION attribute. An action id uniquely
 * identifies an action in an action group. Which action group(s) provide
 * actions depends on the context in which the menu model is used.
 * E.g. when the model is exported as the application menu of a
 * #GtkApplication, actions can be application-wide or window-specific
 * (and thus come from two different action groups). By convention, the
 * application-wide actions have names that start with "app.", while the
 * names of window-specific actions start with "win.".
 *
 * While a wide variety of stateful actions is possible, the following
 * is the minimum that is expected to be supported by all users of exported
 * menu information:
 * - an action with no parameter type and no state
 * - an action with no parameter type and boolean state
 * - an action with string parameter type and string state
 *
 * ## Stateless
 *
 * A stateless action typically corresponds to an ordinary menu item.
 *
 * Selecting such a menu item will activate the action (with no parameter).
 *
 * ## Boolean State
 *
 * An action with a boolean state will most typically be used with a "toggle"
 * or "switch" menu item. The state can be set directly, but activating the
 * action (with no parameter) results in the state being toggled.
 *
 * Selecting a toggle menu item will activate the action. The menu item should
 * be rendered as "checked" when the state is true.
 *
 * ## String Parameter and State
 *
 * Actions with string parameters and state will most typically be used to
 * represent an enumerated choice over the items available for a group of
 * radio menu items. Activating the action with a string parameter is
 * equivalent to setting that parameter as the state.
 *
 * Radio menu items, in addition to being associated with the action, will
 * have a target value. Selecting that menu item will result in activation
 * of the action with the target value as the parameter. The menu item should
 * be rendered as "selected" when the state of the action is equal to the
 * target value of the menu item.

/**
 * SECTION:gpropertyaction
 * @title: GPropertyAction
 * @short_description: A GAction reflecting a GObject property
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * A #GPropertyAction is a way to get a #GAction with a state value
 * reflecting and controlling the value of a #GObject property.
 *
 * The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
 * Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
 * matches the requirements as specified in the #GParamSpec).
 *
 * Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
 * mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
 * int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
 *
 * If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
 * conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
 * "nick" string as per the #GEnumValue table.
 *
 * Flags types are not currently supported.
 *
 * Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
 * supported and probably never will be.
 *
 * Properties of #GVariant types are not currently supported.
 *
 * If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a NULL
 * parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
 * toggle the value of the property.
 *
 * In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
 * the property.
 *
 * The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
 * particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
 * between). #GPropertyAction does not have a separate state that is kept
 * in sync with the property value -- its state is the property value.
 *
 * For example, it might be useful to create a #GAction corresponding to
 * the "visible-child-name" property of a #GtkStack so that the current
 * page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio indication in the
 * menu is then directly determined from the active page of the
 * #GtkStack.
 *
 * An anti-example would be binding the "active-id" property on a
 * #GtkComboBox.  This is because the state of the combobox itself is
 * probably uninteresting and is actually being used to control
 * something else.
 *
 * Another anti-example would be to bind to the "visible-child-name"
 * property of a #GtkStack if this value is actually stored in
 * #GSettings.  In that case, the real source of the value is
 * #GSettings.  If you want a #GAction to control a setting stored in
 * #GSettings, see g_settings_create_action() instead, and possibly
 * combine its use with g_settings_bind().

/**
 * SECTION:gresource
 * @short_description: Resource framework
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * Applications and libraries often contain binary or textual data that is
 * really part of the application, rather than user data. For instance
 * #GtkBuilder .ui files, splashscreen images, GMenu markup XML, CSS files,
 * icons, etc. These are often shipped as files in `$datadir/appname`, or
 * manually included as literal strings in the code.
 *
 * The #GResource API and the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
 * provide a convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties. You
 * maintain the files as normal files, so its easy to edit them, but during the build the files
 * are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the executable. This means that loading
 * the resource files are efficient (as they are already in memory, shared with other instances) and
 * simple (no need to check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
 * also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included in the resource bundle
 * in a compressed form, but will be automatically uncompressed when the resource is used. This
 * is very useful e.g. for larger text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
 *
 * Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
 * `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
 * The only options currently supported are:
 *
 * `xml-stripblanks` which will use the xmllint command
 * to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
 * the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
 * the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
 * the preprocessing step is skipped.
 *
 * `to-pixdata` which will use the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata command to convert
 * images to the GdkPixdata format, which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside
 * the resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata
 * program must be in the PATH, or the `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be
 * set to the full path to the gdk-pixbuf-pixdata executable; otherwise the resource compiler will
 * abort.
 *
 * Resource files will be exported in the GResource namespace using the
 * combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
 * The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
 * different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
 * include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
 * directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
 *
 * Resource bundles are created by the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
 * which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that the XML references. These
 * are combined into a binary resource bundle.
 *
 * An example resource description:
 * |[
 * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 * <gresources>
 *   <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
 *     <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
 *     <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
 *     <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
 *     <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
 *   </gresource>
 * </gresources>
 * ]|
 *
 * This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
 * |[
 * /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
 * /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
 * /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
 * /org/gtk/Example/example.css
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use Java-style
 * path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
 *
 * You can then use [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] to compile the XML to a
 * binary bundle that you can load with g_resource_load(). However, its more common to use the --generate-source and
 * --generate-header arguments to create a source file and header to link directly into your application.
 * This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
 * `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
 * to [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources]. `get_resource()` returns
 * the generated #GResource object. The register and unregister functions
 * register the resource so its files can be accessed using
 * g_resources_lookup_data().
 *
 * Once a #GResource has been created and registered all the data in it can be accessed globally in the process by
 * using API calls like g_resources_open_stream() to stream the data or g_resources_lookup_data() to get a direct pointer
 * to the data. You can also use URIs like "resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png" with #GFile to access
 * the resource data.
 *
 * Some higher-level APIs, such as #GtkApplication, will automatically load
 * resources from certain well-known paths in the resource namespace as a
 * convenience. See the documentation for those APIs for details.
 *
 * There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the compiler support for constructor
 * and destructor functions (where available) to automatically create and register the #GResource on startup
 * or library load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to register/unregister the resource are created
 * instead. This requires an explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all platforms,
 * even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported. (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
 *
 * Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a library, so if you are unloading libraries
 * during runtime you need to be very careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes away
 * when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally a problem, since most resource accesses
 * are for your own resources, and resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
 *
 * When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is often useful to be able to
 * replace resources in the program or library, without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing
 * purposes. Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment variable to selectively overlay
 * resources with replacements from the filesystem.  It is a %G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR-separated list of substitutions to perform
 * during resource lookups.
 *
 * A substitution has the form
 *
 * |[
 *    /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
 * ]|
 *
 * The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay applies.  The part after is a
 * filesystem path which contains files and subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
 * equivalent names.
 *
 * In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the resource path
 * `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then GResource would check the filesystem path
 * `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was found there, it would be used instead.  This is an
 * overlay, not an outright replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the built-in
 * version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently supported.
 *
 * Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash before the '='.  The path after
 * the slash should ideally be absolute, but this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the
 * location of a single resource with an individual file.
 *
 * Since: 2.32

 */


/**
 * SECTION:gsettings
 * @short_description: High-level API for application settings
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * The #GSettings class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
 * application settings.
 *
 * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
 * settings with #GSettings is typically extremely fast: on
 * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
 * #GHashTable lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
 * of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
 * for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
 * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
 * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
 * a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
 * even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
 * only ever modify #GSettings keys in response to explicit user action.
 * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
 * made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
 * of preferences widgets.  The built-in g_settings_bind() functionality
 * is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
 * result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
 *
 * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 *
 * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be '[relocatable][gsettings-relocatable]', i.e. not equipped with
 * a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 *
 * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
 * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
 * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
 * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
 * "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
 * Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
 * they often did in GConf.
 *
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as #GVariant, and allows any #GVariantType for keys. Key names
 * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
 * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
 *
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
 * elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
 * the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
 * the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
 *
 * The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
 * [locale category for
 * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
 * The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
 * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
 * XML comment immediately above the <default> element — it is recommended to
 * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
 * implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
 * attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
 * defaults which use the same string.
 *
 * For example:
 * |[
 *  <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
 *       GVariant serialization syntax.
 *       See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
 *  <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
 * ]|
 *
 * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
 * #GVariants (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
 * errors will occur.
 *
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas]
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
 *
 * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
 * [gschema.dtd](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/gschema.dtd)
 *
 * The [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] tool expects schema
 * files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
 *
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
 * id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
 * ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
 * e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
 * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
 * and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
 * associated with one named application, the id should not use
 * StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
 *
 * In addition to #GVariant types, keys can have types that have
 * enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
 * <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
 * [example][schema-enumerated]. The underlying type of such a key
 * is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(), g_settings_set_enum(),
 * g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags() access the numeric values
 * corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
 *
 * An example for default value:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
 *
 *     <key name="greeting" type="s">
 *       <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
 *       <summary>A greeting</summary>
 *       <description>
 *         Greeting of the invading martians
 *       </description>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="box" type="(ii)">
 *       <default>(20,30)</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="empty-string" type="s">
 *       <default>""</default>
 *       <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
 *     </key>
 *
 *   </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 *
 * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 *
 *   <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
 *     <value nick="first" value="1"/>
 *     <value nick="second" value="2"/>
 *   </enum>
 *
 *   <flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags">
 *     <value nick="flag1" value="1"/>
 *     <value nick="flag2" value="2"/>
 *     <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
 *   </flags>
 *
 *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
 *
 *     <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
 *       <range min="1" max="100"/>
 *       <default>10</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
 *       <choices>
 *         <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
 *         <choice value='Annabeth'/>
 *         <choice value='Joe'/>
 *       </choices>
 *       <aliases>
 *         <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>
 *         <alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/>
 *       </aliases>
 *       <default>'Joe'</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'>
 *       <default>'first'</default>
 *     </key>
 *
 *     <key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'>
 *       <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
 *     </key>
 *   </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Vendor overrides
 *
 * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 * is inconvenient and error-prone,
 * [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] reads so-called vendor
 * override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
 * schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
 * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
 * serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
 * |[
 *     [org.gtk.Example]
 *     key1='string'
 *     key2=1.5
 * ]|
 *
 * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
 * `.gschema.override`.
 *
 * ## Binding
 *
 * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind #GObject properties
 * directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
 * has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
 * propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
 * between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
 *
 * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 * looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
 * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 * If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 * #G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY flag.
 *
 * ## Relocatable schemas # {#gsettings-relocatable}
 *
 * A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
 * <schema> element. By using g_settings_new_with_path(), a #GSettings object
 * can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
 * instance. Paths passed to g_settings_new_with_path() will typically be
 * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
 * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
 * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
 * dependency library.
 *
 * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
 * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
 * `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
 * they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
 * |[
 * <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
 *   <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
 * </schema>
 * ]|
 *
 * ## Build system integration # {#gsettings-build-system}
 *
 * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
 * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
 * following to your `configure.ac`:
 * |[
 * GLIB_GSETTINGS
 * ]|
 *
 * In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
 * install the named schema:
 * |[
 * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
 *
 * @GSETTINGS_RULES@
 * ]|
 *
 * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
 * translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
 * be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
 * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
 * |[
 * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 *
 * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
 * |[
 * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 *
 * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
 * <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
 * attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
 * by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
 * `.gschema.xml.in` template.
 *
 * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
 * schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
 * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
 * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
 * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
 * |[
 * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
 * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
 * ]|
 *
 * `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
 * which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
 * `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
 * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
 * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
 * `EXTRA_DIST`.

/**
 * SECTION:gsettingsschema
 * @short_description: Introspecting and controlling the loading
 *     of GSettings schemas
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * The #GSettingsSchemaSource and #GSettingsSchema APIs provide a
 * mechanism for advanced control over the loading of schemas and a
 * mechanism for introspecting their content.
 *
 * Plugin loading systems that wish to provide plugins a way to access
 * settings face the problem of how to make the schemas for these
 * settings visible to GSettings.  Typically, a plugin will want to ship
 * the schema along with itself and it won't be installed into the
 * standard system directories for schemas.
 *
 * #GSettingsSchemaSource provides a mechanism for dealing with this by
 * allowing the creation of a new 'schema source' from which schemas can
 * be acquired.  This schema source can then become part of the metadata
 * associated with the plugin and queried whenever the plugin requires
 * access to some settings.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * typedef struct
 * {
 *    ...
 *    GSettingsSchemaSource *schema_source;
 *    ...
 * } Plugin;
 *
 * Plugin *
 * initialise_plugin (const gchar *dir)
 * {
 *   Plugin *plugin;
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   plugin->schema_source =
 *     g_settings_schema_source_new_from_directory (dir,
 *       g_settings_schema_source_get_default (), FALSE, NULL);
 *
 *   ...
 *
 *   return plugin;
 * }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * GSettings *
 * plugin_get_settings (Plugin      *plugin,
 *                      const gchar *schema_id)
 * {
 *   GSettingsSchema *schema;
 *
 *   if (schema_id == NULL)
 *     schema_id = plugin->identifier;
 *
 *   schema = g_settings_schema_source_lookup (plugin->schema_source,
 *                                             schema_id, FALSE);
 *
 *   if (schema == NULL)
 *     {
 *       ... disable the plugin or abort, etc ...
 *     }
 *
 *   return g_settings_new_full (schema, NULL, NULL);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * The code above shows how hooks should be added to the code that
 * initialises (or enables) the plugin to create the schema source and
 * how an API can be added to the plugin system to provide a convenient
 * way for the plugin to access its settings, using the schemas that it
 * ships.
 *
 * From the standpoint of the plugin, it would need to ensure that it
 * ships a gschemas.compiled file as part of itself, and then simply do
 * the following:
 *
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * {
 *   GSettings *settings;
 *   gint some_value;
 *
 *   settings = plugin_get_settings (self, NULL);
 *   some_value = g_settings_get_int (settings, "some-value");
 *   ...
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * It's also possible that the plugin system expects the schema source
 * files (ie: .gschema.xml files) instead of a gschemas.compiled file.
 * In that case, the plugin loading system must compile the schemas for
 * itself before attempting to create the settings source.

/**
 * SECTION:gsimpleasyncresult
 * @short_description: Simple asynchronous results implementation
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GAsyncResult, #GTask
 *
 * As of GLib 2.46, #GSimpleAsyncResult is deprecated in favor of
 * #GTask, which provides a simpler API.
 *
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult implements #GAsyncResult.
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResult handles #GAsyncReadyCallbacks, error
 * reporting, operation cancellation and the final state of an operation,
 * completely transparent to the application. Results can be returned
 * as a pointer e.g. for functions that return data that is collected
 * asynchronously, a boolean value for checking the success or failure
 * of an operation, or a #gssize for operations which return the number
 * of bytes modified by the operation; all of the simple return cases
 * are covered.
 *
 * Most of the time, an application will not need to know of the details
 * of this API; it is handled transparently, and any necessary operations
 * are handled by #GAsyncResult's interface. However, if implementing a
 * new GIO module, for writing language bindings, or for complex
 * applications that need better control of how asynchronous operations
 * are completed, it is important to understand this functionality.
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResults are tagged with the calling function to ensure
 * that asynchronous functions and their finishing functions are used
 * together correctly.
 *
 * To create a new #GSimpleAsyncResult, call g_simple_async_result_new().
 * If the result needs to be created for a #GError, use
 * g_simple_async_result_new_from_error() or
 * g_simple_async_result_new_take_error(). If a #GError is not available
 * (e.g. the asynchronous operation's doesn't take a #GError argument),
 * but the result still needs to be created for an error condition, use
 * g_simple_async_result_new_error() (or g_simple_async_result_set_error_va()
 * if your application or binding requires passing a variable argument list
 * directly), and the error can then be propagated through the use of
 * g_simple_async_result_propagate_error().
 *
 * An asynchronous operation can be made to ignore a cancellation event by
 * calling g_simple_async_result_set_handle_cancellation() with a
 * #GSimpleAsyncResult for the operation and %FALSE. This is useful for
 * operations that are dangerous to cancel, such as close (which would
 * cause a leak if cancelled before being run).
 *
 * GSimpleAsyncResult can integrate into GLib's event loop, #GMainLoop,
 * or it can use #GThreads.
 * g_simple_async_result_complete() will finish an I/O task directly
 * from the point where it is called. g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle()
 * will finish it from an idle handler in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * where the #GSimpleAsyncResult was created.
 * g_simple_async_result_run_in_thread() will run the job in a
 * separate thread and then use
 * g_simple_async_result_complete_in_idle() to deliver the result.
 *
 * To set the results of an asynchronous function,
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer(),
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gboolean(), and
 * g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gssize()
 * are provided, setting the operation's result to a gpointer, gboolean, or
 * gssize, respectively.
 *

/**
 * SECTION:gsocket
 * @short_description: Low-level socket object
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GInitable, [<gnetworking.h>][gio-gnetworking.h]
 *
 * A #GSocket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
 * direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
 * It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
 *
 * #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
 * network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
 * use it directly, but rather through classes like #GSocketClient,
 * #GSocketService and #GSocketConnection. However there may be cases where
 * direct use of #GSocket is useful.
 *
 * #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually constructed
 * by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check the
 * results before using the object. This is done automatically in
 * g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
 * %NULL.
 *
 * Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
 * in blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
 * parameter) block until the requested operation
 * is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
 * would block return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error.
 * To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_socket_condition_check(),
 * or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
 * attach it to a #GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
 * Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
 * blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
 *
 * When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
 * function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
 * of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
 * reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
 * until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 *
 * #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
 * For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
 * either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
 * address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
 * specified or received in each I/O operation.
 *
 * All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
 *
 * Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
 * ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
 * command-line utility that uses #GSocket, you may need to take into
 * account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
 * if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
 *
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
 * a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
 * locking.

 * @short_description: Child processes
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GSubprocessLauncher
 *
 * #GSubprocess allows the creation of and interaction with child
 * processes.
 *
 * Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs (ie:
 * #GInputStream, #GOutputStream).  There are GIO-style APIs to wait for
 * process termination (ie: cancellable and with an asynchronous
 * variant).
 *
 * There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a
 * race-free API for sending UNIX signals to a subprocess.
 *
 * One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
 * comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such
 * g_output_stream_splice_async().  This makes GSubprocess
 * significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
 * some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`
 * included with Python.  For example, using #GSubprocess one could
 * create two child processes, reading standard output from the first,
 * processing it, and writing to the input stream of the second, all
 * without blocking the main loop.
 *
 * A powerful g_subprocess_communicate() API is provided similar to the
 * `communicate()` method of `subprocess.py`. This enables very easy
 * interaction with a subprocess that has been opened with pipes.
 *
 * #GSubprocess defaults to tight control over the file descriptors open
 * in the child process, avoiding dangling-fd issues that are caused by
 * a simple fork()/exec().  The only open file descriptors in the
 * spawned process are ones that were explicitly specified by the
 * #GSubprocess API (unless %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_INHERIT_FDS was
 * specified).
 *
 * #GSubprocess will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
 * avoiding "zombie processes" remaining around for long periods of
 * time.  g_subprocess_wait() can be used to wait for this to happen,
 * but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
 *
 * As a matter of principle, #GSubprocess has no API that accepts
 * shell-style space-separated strings.  It will, however, match the
 * typical shell behaviour of searching the PATH for executables that do
 * not contain a directory separator in their name.
 *
 * #GSubprocess attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
 * spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
 * kinds of input and output redirection).  See g_subprocess_new(). The
 * #GSubprocessLauncher API is provided for more complicated cases
 * (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
 * change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
 *
 * A typical use of #GSubprocess will involve calling
 * g_subprocess_new(), followed by g_subprocess_wait_async() or
 * g_subprocess_wait().  After the process exits, the status can be
 * checked using functions such as g_subprocess_get_if_exited() (which
 * are similar to the familiar WIFEXITED-style POSIX macros).

 *
 * A #GTask represents and manages a cancellable "task".
 *
 * ## Asynchronous operations
 *
 * The most common usage of #GTask is as a #GAsyncResult, to
 * manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
 * g_task_new() in the "start" method, followed by
 * g_task_set_task_data() and the like if you need to keep some
 * additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
 * task object around through your asynchronous operation.
 * Eventually, you will call a method such as
 * g_task_return_pointer() or g_task_return_error(), which will
 * save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
 * function in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
 * loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the #GTask back to
 * the operation's finish function (as a #GAsyncResult), and you can
 * use g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like to extract the
 * return value.
 *
 * Here is an example for using GTask as a GAsyncResult:

 * ## Chained asynchronous operations
 *
 * #GTask also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that
 * internally chain together several smaller asynchronous
 * operations. g_task_get_cancellable(), g_task_get_context(),
 * and g_task_get_priority() allow you to get back the task's
 * #GCancellable, #GMainContext, and [I/O priority][io-priority]
 * when starting a new subtask, so you don't have to keep track
 * of them yourself. g_task_attach_source() simplifies the case
 * of waiting for a source to fire (automatically using the correct
 * #GMainContext and priority).
 *

 * where the #GTask was created.

 * ## Adding cancellability to uncancellable tasks
 *
 * Finally, g_task_run_in_thread() and g_task_run_in_thread_sync()
 * can be used to turn an uncancellable operation into a
 * cancellable one. If you call g_task_set_return_on_cancel(),
 * passing %TRUE, then if the task's #GCancellable is cancelled,
 * it will return control back to the caller immediately, while
 * allowing the task thread to continue running in the background
 * (and simply discarding its result when it finally does finish).
 * Provided that the task thread is careful about how it uses
 * locks and other externally-visible resources, this allows you
 * to make "GLib-friendly" asynchronous and cancellable
 * synchronous variants of blocking APIs.

 * ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
 *
 * #GTask's API attempts to be simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult's
 * in several ways:
 * - You can save task-specific data with g_task_set_task_data(), and
 *   retrieve it later with g_task_get_task_data(). This replaces the
 *   abuse of g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer() for the same
 *   purpose with #GSimpleAsyncResult.
 * - In addition to the task data, #GTask also keeps track of the
 *   [priority][io-priority], #GCancellable, and
 *   #GMainContext associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
 *   a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
 *   to those values when starting each sub-task.
 * - g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() provides simplified
 *   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
 *   overrides any other #GTask return value by default, like
 *   #GSimpleAsyncResult does when
 *   g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable() is called.
 *   (You can use g_task_set_check_cancellable() to turn off that
 *   behavior.) On the other hand, g_task_run_in_thread()
 *   guarantees that it will always run your
 *   `task_func`, even if the task's #GCancellable
 *   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
 *   you can start your `task_func` with a
 *   g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() check if you need the
 *   old behavior.
 * - The "return" methods (eg, g_task_return_pointer())
 *   automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
 *   there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
 *   in idle" distinction. (#GTask automatically figures out
 *   whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
 *   if it needs to be sent to another #GMainContext, or delayed
 *   until the next iteration of the current #GMainContext.)
 * - The "finish" functions for #GTask based operations are generally
 *   much simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult ones, normally consisting
 *   of only a single call to g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like.
 *   Since g_task_propagate_pointer() "steals" the return value from
 *   the #GTask, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
 *   prevent it from being freed twice.
 * - With #GSimpleAsyncResult, it was common to call
 *   g_simple_async_result_propagate_error() from the
 *   `_finish()` wrapper function, and have
 *   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
 *   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
 *   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
 *   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
 *   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
 *   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
 *   Note that wrapper methods can now use
 *   g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error() to do old-style
 *   #GSimpleAsyncResult error-returning behavior, and
 *   g_async_result_is_tagged() to check if a result is tagged as
 *   having come from the `_async()` wrapper
 *   function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
 *   0 to g_input_stream_read_async()).

/**
 * SECTION:gtestdbus
 * @short_description: D-Bus testing helper
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user's
 * session bus.
 *
 * Note that #GTestDBus modifies the user’s environment, calling setenv().
 * This is not thread-safe, so all #GTestDBus calls should be completed before
 * threads are spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access
 * conflicts to environment variables shared between #GTestDBus and other
 * threads.
 *
 * ## Creating unit tests using GTestDBus
 *
 * Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
 * D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
 * usually don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
 * target system. The #GTestDBus object makes this easier for us by taking care
 * of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
 * up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
 * code tree.
 *
 * The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
 * D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
 * is a good place to put this file.
 *
 * The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
 * uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
 * achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
 * directory and have it processed by configure.
 * |[
 *     [D-BUS Service]
 *     Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
 *     Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
 * ]|
 * You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
 * fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
 * test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
 * preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
 * |[
 *     -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
 * ]|
 *     Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
 * you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the #GTestDBus scaffolding.
 *
 * An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
 * here:
 * [gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
 *
 * Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
 * service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
 * some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
 * service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your test service
 * not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances are that your service
 * and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there is an older version of the
 * schema file sitting in the install location).
 *
 * Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
 * environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
 * created by #GTestDBus and then in turn inherited by any services the
 * D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
 * a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
 * rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
 * `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
 * in the above fixture_setup() routine.
 *
 * The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This can be achieved
 * by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running test cases, an autotools setup might
 * do the following in the directory holding schemas:
 * |[
 *     all-am:
 *             $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
 *
 *     CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled
 * ]|

 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GTlsConnection and related classes provide TLS (Transport Layer
 * Security, previously known as SSL, Secure Sockets Layer) support for
 * gio-based network streams.
 *
 * #GDtlsConnection and related classes provide DTLS (Datagram TLS) support for
 * GIO-based network sockets, using the #GDatagramBased interface. The TLS and
 * DTLS APIs are almost identical, except TLS is stream-based and DTLS is
 * datagram-based. They share certificate and backend infrastructure.
 *
 * In the simplest case, for a client TLS connection, you can just set the
 * #GSocketClient:tls flag on a #GSocketClient, and then any
 * connections created by that client will have TLS negotiated
 * automatically, using appropriate default settings, and rejecting
 * any invalid or self-signed certificates (unless you change that
 * default by setting the #GSocketClient:tls-validation-flags
 * property). The returned object will be a #GTcpWrapperConnection,
 * which wraps the underlying #GTlsClientConnection.
 *
 * For greater control, you can create your own #GTlsClientConnection,
 * wrapping a #GSocketConnection (or an arbitrary #GIOStream with
 * pollable input and output streams) and then connect to its signals,
 * such as #GTlsConnection::accept-certificate, before starting the
 * handshake.
 *
 * Server-side TLS is similar, using #GTlsServerConnection. At the

 * The #GVolume interface represents user-visible objects that can be

 * equivalent of #GnomeVFSDrive.
 *
 * Mounting a #GVolume instance is an asynchronous operation. For more
 * information about asynchronous operations, see #GAsyncResult and
 * #GTask. To mount a #GVolume, first call g_volume_mount() with (at
 * least) the #GVolume instance, optionally a #GMountOperation object
 * and a #GAsyncReadyCallback.
 *
 * Typically, one will only want to pass %NULL for the
 * #GMountOperation if automounting all volumes when a desktop session
 * starts since it's not desirable to put up a lot of dialogs asking
 * for credentials.
 *
 * The callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either
 * with success or failure), and a #GAsyncResult instance will be
 * passed to the callback.  That callback should then call
 * g_volume_mount_finish() with the #GVolume instance and the
 * #GAsyncResult data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully.  If an @error is present when g_volume_mount_finish()
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.
 *
 * ## Volume Identifiers # {#volume-identifier}
 *
 * It is sometimes necessary to directly access the underlying
 * operating system object behind a volume (e.g. for passing a volume

 * allows to obtain an 'identifier' for the volume. There can be
 * different kinds of identifiers, such as Hal UDIs, filesystem labels,
 * traditional Unix devices (e.g. `/dev/sda2`), UUIDs. GIO uses predefined
 * strings as names for the different kinds of identifiers:
 * #G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UUID, #G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_LABEL, etc.
 * Use g_volume_get_identifier() to obtain an identifier for a volume.
 *
 *
 * Note that #G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_HAL_UDI will only be available
 * when the gvfs hal volume monitor is in use. Other volume monitors
 * will generally be able to provide the #G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UNIX_DEVICE

 *
 * Adds main option entries to be handled by @application.
 *
 * This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_main_entries().
 *
 * After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
 * point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by @arg_data
 * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
 *
 * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
 * @arg_data for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
 * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
 * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
 * inspected and modified.  If %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is
 * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
 * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
 * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
 * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
 * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
 * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
 *
 * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
 * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
 * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
 * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
 * possible to either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and
 * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
 *
 * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
 * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
 * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
 * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
 * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
 * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
 *
 * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
 * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
 * @arg_data is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
 * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
 * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
 * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
 * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
 *
 * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
 * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use b
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use &s
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use i
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use x
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use d
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use ^ay

 *
 * Adds a #GOptionGroup to the commandline handling of @application.
 *
 * This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_group().
 *
 * Unlike g_application_add_main_option_entries(), this function does
 * not deal with %NULL @arg_data and never transmits options to the
 * primary instance.
 *
 * The reason for that is because, by the time the options arrive at the
 * primary instance, it is typically too late to do anything with them.
 * Taking the GTK option group as an example: GTK will already have been
 * initialised by the time the #GApplication::command-line handler runs.
 * In the case that this is not the first-running instance of the
 * application, the existing instance may already have been running for
 * a very long time.
 *
 * This means that the options from #GOptionGroup are only really usable
 * in the case that the instance of the application being run is the
 * first instance.  Passing options like `--display=` or `--gdk-debug=`
 * on future runs will have no effect on the existing primary instance.
 *
 * Calling this function will cause the options in the supplied option

 *
 * Application identifiers follow the same format as
 * [D-Bus well-known bus names](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
 * For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
 * reproduced here:
 *
 * - Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
 *   period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.
 *
 * - Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
 *   with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
 *   begin with a digit.
 *
 * - Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
 *   (and thus at least two elements).
 *
 * - Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
 *
 * - Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
 *
 * Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
 * but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
 * refer to D-Bus, such as
 * [Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
 * the
 * [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
 * and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
 * resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
 * require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
 * identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.
 *
 * Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
 * reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
 * it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
 * words run together, with initial capital letters.
 *
 * As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
 * hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
 * contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
 * For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an
 * archiving application, it might be named `org._7_zip.Archiver`.

 *
 * Runs the application.
 *
 * This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
 * is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
 * the @argc, @argv parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
 * to pass %NULL if @argv is not available or commandline handling is not
 * required.  Note that on Windows, @argc and @argv are ignored, and
 * g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
 * of Unicode commandline arguments).
 *
 * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
 * can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
 * g_application_add_main_option_entries().  After this, the
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the
 * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
 *
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
 * such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
 * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
 * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
 * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
 * the process.
 *
 * What happens next depends on the flags: if
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
 * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
 * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
 * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
 * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
 * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
 * via the #GApplication::open signal.
 *
 * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
 * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
 * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
 * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
 * suppress the default handling. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][gapplication-example-cmdline2]
 * for an example.
 *
 * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
 * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
 * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
 * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
 *
 * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
 * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
 * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
 * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
 * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
 * use.
 *
 * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
 * to the basename of argv[0].
 *
 * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
 * for the duration that the application is running.

 * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
 * commandline processing is interrupted and the
 * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
 * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
 * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
 * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
 * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
 * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
 * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
 * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
 * control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
 * what their exit status will be.

 * @cancellable: optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.
 * @callback: a #GAsyncReadyCallback to call when the request is satisfied
 * @user_data: the data to pass to callback function
 *
 * Starts asynchronous initialization of the object implementing the
 * interface. This must be done before any real use of the object after
 * initial construction. If the object also implements #GInitable you can
 * optionally call g_initable_init() instead.
 *
 * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
 * g_async_initable_new_async() should typically be used instead.
 *
 * When the initialization is finished, @callback will be called. You can
 * then call g_async_initable_init_finish() to get the result of the
 * initialization.
 *
 * Implementations may also support cancellation. If @cancellable is not
 * %NULL, then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable
 * object from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If @cancellable is not %NULL, and
 * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization, the error
 * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
 *
 * As with #GInitable, if the object is not initialized, or initialization
 * returns with an error, then all operations on the object except
 * g_object_ref() and g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and
 * have undefined behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or
 * g_warning(), but this must not be relied on.
 *
 * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GAsyncInitable can
 * be initialized multiple times; for more information, see g_initable_init().
 * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times,
 * implementation requires yielding all subsequent calls to init_async() on the
 * results of the first call.
 *
 * For classes that also support the #GInitable interface, the default
 * implementation of this method will run the g_initable_init() function
 * in a thread, so if you want to support asynchronous initialization via
 * threads, just implement the #GAsyncInitable interface without overriding
 * any interface methods.

 * @bytes_written: (out): will be set to the number of bytes written to @outbuf on success
 * @error: location to store the error occurring, or %NULL to ignore
 *
 * This is the main operation used when converting data. It is to be called
 * multiple times in a loop, and each time it will do some work, i.e.
 * producing some output (in @outbuf) or consuming some input (from @inbuf) or
 * both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
 *
 * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
 * Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
 * in the converter producing output.
 *
 * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
 * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
 * next call.
 *
 * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
 * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
 * data after the data in @inbuf, the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
 * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
 * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
 * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED
 * may be returned even if %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is not set, for instance
 * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
 * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
 *
 * When some data has successfully been converted @bytes_read and is set to
 * the number of bytes read from @inbuf, and @bytes_written is set to indicate
 * how many bytes was written to @outbuf. If there are more data to output
 * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
 * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
 * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
 *
 * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and @error is set accordingly.
 * Some errors need special handling:
 *
 * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
 * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
 * call the function again with a larger @outbuf to continue.
 *
 * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
 * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
 * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
 * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
 * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
 * further input). It may also happen when @inbuf_size is zero and
 * there is no more data to produce.
 *
 * When this happens the application should read more input and then
 * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
 * more data call the function again with the same data but with
 * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
 * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
 * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
 * input is actually partial).
 *
 * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
 * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
 * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
 * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
 * initial state.
 *
 * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
 * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
 * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
 * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
 * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
 * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
 * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
 * but done in the middle of the data.
 *
 * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
 * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
 * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
 * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
 * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
 * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
 * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
 * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
 * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
 *
 * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
 * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
 * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
 * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).

 * contains a pointer to an array of #GInputVector structs describing the

 *
 * @flags modify how all messages are received. The commonly available

 * values there are the same as the system values, and the flags
 * are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too. These
 * flags affect the overall receive operation. Flags affecting individual
 * messages are returned in #GInputMessage.flags.
 *
 * The other members of #GInputMessage are treated as described in its
 * documentation.
 *
 * If @timeout is negative the call will block until @num_messages have been
 * received, the connection is closed remotely (EOS), @cancellable is cancelled,
 * or an error occurs.
 *
 * If @timeout is 0 the call will return up to @num_messages without blocking,
 * or %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK if no messages are queued in the operating system
 * to be received.
 *
 * If @timeout is positive the call will block on the same conditions as if
 * @timeout were negative. If the timeout is reached
 * before any messages are received, %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT is returned,
 * otherwise it will return the number of messages received before timing out.
 * (Note: This is effectively the behaviour of `MSG_WAITFORONE` with

 *
 * To be notified when messages are available, wait for the %G_IO_IN condition.
 * Note though that you may still receive %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from
 * g_datagram_based_receive_messages() even if you were previously notified of a
 * %G_IO_IN condition.
 *
 * If the remote peer closes the connection, any messages queued in the
 * underlying receive buffer will be returned, and subsequent calls to
 * g_datagram_based_receive_messages() will return 0 (with no error set).
 *
 * If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling g_socket_close() or
 * g_socket_shutdown() with @shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket, for
 * example), all calls to this function will return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED.
 *
 * On error -1 is returned and @error is set accordingly. An error will only
 * be returned if zero messages could be received; otherwise the number of
 * messages successfully received before the error will be returned. If
 * @cancellable is cancelled, %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED is returned as with any

 *
 * Returns: number of messages received, or -1 on error. Note that the number

 * general approach to handling that is to not check, but just do the
 * operation and handle the errors as they come.
 *
 * As an example of race-free checking, take the case of reading a file,
 * and if it doesn't exist, creating it. There are two racy versions: read
 * it, and on error create it; and: check if it exists, if not create it.
 * These can both result in two processes creating the file (with perhaps
 * a partially written file as the result). The correct approach is to
 * always try to create the file with g_file_create() which will either
 * atomically create the file or fail with a %G_IO_ERROR_EXISTS error.
 *
 * However, in many cases an existence check is useful in a user interface,
 * for instance to make a menu item sensitive/insensitive, so that you don't

 * dialog. If you do this, you should make sure to also handle the errors

 *
 * Initializes the object implementing the interface.
 *
 * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
 * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
 *
 * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
 * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
 *
 * Implementations may also support cancellation. If @cancellable is not %NULL,
 * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
 * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If @cancellable is not %NULL and
 * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
 * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
 *
 * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
 * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
 * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
 * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
 *
 * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
 * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
 * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
 * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
 * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
 * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
 *
 * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
 * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
 * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
 * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
 *
 * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
 * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
 * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
 * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
 * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
 * instance.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if successful. If an error has occurred, this function will

 * Closes the stream, releasing resources related to it. This will also
 * close the individual input and output streams, if they are not already

 *
 * Once the stream is closed, all other operations will return
 * %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED. Closing a stream multiple times will not
 * return an error.
 *
 * Closing a stream will automatically flush any outstanding buffers
 * in the stream.
 *
 * Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference
 * is dropped, but you might want to call this function to make sure
 * resources are released as early as possible.
 *
 * Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file
 * descriptor) open after the stream is closed. See the documentation for
 * the individual stream for details.
 *
 * On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the
 * close operation will finish as much as possible. A stream that failed
 * to close will still return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 * Still, it is important to check and report the error to the user,
 * otherwise there might be a loss of data as all data might not be written.
 *
 * If @cancellable is not NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
 * triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation
 * was cancelled, the error %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned.
 * Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
 * can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.

 * If @root_group is non-%NULL then it specifies the name of the keyfile

 * 12 then the following would appear in the keyfile:
 *
 * |[
 *   [profiles/default]
 *   font-size=12
 * ]|
 *
 * The backend will refuse writes (and return writability as being
 * %FALSE) for keys outside of @root_path and, in the event that
 * @root_group is %NULL, also for keys directly under @root_path.
 * Writes will also be refused if the backend detects that it has the
 * inability to rewrite the keyfile (ie: the containing directory is not

 *
 * There is no checking done for your key namespace clashing with the
 * syntax of the key file format.  For example, if you have '[' or ']'

 * This is a convenience API around g_menu_item_new() and

 *
 * The effect of having one menu appear as a section of another is
 * exactly as it sounds: the items from @section become a direct part of
 * the menu that @menu_item is added to.
 *
 * Visual separation is typically displayed between two non-empty
 * sections.  If @label is non-%NULL then it will be encorporated into
 * this visual indication.  This allows for labeled subsections of a
 * menu.
 *
 * As a simple example, consider a typical "Edit" menu from a simple
 * program.  It probably contains an "Undo" and "Redo" item, followed by
 * a separator, followed by "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste".
 *
 * This would be accomplished by creating three #GMenu instances.  The
 * first would be populated with the "Undo" and "Redo" items, and the
 * second with the "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste" items.  The first and
 * second menus would then be added as submenus of the third.  In XML
 * format, this would look something like the following:
 * |[
 * <menu id='edit-menu'>
 *   <section>
 *     <item label='Undo'/>
 *     <item label='Redo'/>

 *     <item label='Cut'/>
 *     <item label='Copy'/>
 *     <item label='Paste'/>
 *   </section>
 * </menu>
 * ]|
 *
 * The following example is exactly equivalent.  It is more illustrative
 * of the exact relationship between the menus and items (keeping in
 * mind that the 'link' element defines a new menu that is linked to the
 * containing one).  The style of the second example is more verbose and
 * difficult to read (and therefore not recommended except for the
 * purpose of understanding what is really going on).
 * |[

 * In certain situations, you may also want to bind a socket that will be
 * used to initiate connections, though this is not normally required.
 *
 * If @socket is a TCP socket, then @allow_reuse controls the setting
 * of the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option; normally it should be %TRUE for
 * server sockets (sockets that you will eventually call
 * g_socket_accept() on), and %FALSE for client sockets. (Failing to
 * set this flag on a server socket may cause g_socket_bind() to return
 * %G_IO_ERROR_ADDRESS_IN_USE if the server program is stopped and then

 *
 * If @socket is a UDP socket, then @allow_reuse determines whether or
 * not other UDP sockets can be bound to the same address at the same
 * time. In particular, you can have several UDP sockets bound to the

/**
 * g_volume_monitor_adopt_orphan_mount:
 * @mount: a #GMount object to find a parent for
 *
 * This function should be called by any #GVolumeMonitor
 * implementation when a new #GMount object is created that is not
 * associated with a #GVolume object. It must be called just before
 * emitting the @mount_added signal.
 *
 * If the return value is not %NULL, the caller must associate the
 * returned #GVolume object with the #GMount. This involves returning
 * it in its g_mount_get_volume() implementation. The caller must
 * also listen for the "removed" signal on the returned object
 * and give up its reference when handling that signal
 *
 * Similarly, if implementing g_volume_monitor_adopt_orphan_mount(),
 * the implementor must take a reference to @mount and return it in
 * its g_volume_get_mount() implemented. Also, the implementor must
 * listen for the "unmounted" signal on @mount and give up its
 * reference upon handling that signal.
 *
 * There are two main use cases for this function.
 *
 * One is when implementing a user space file system driver that reads
 * blocks of a block device that is already represented by the native
 * volume monitor (for example a CD Audio file system driver). Such
 * a driver will generate its own #GMount object that needs to be
 * associated with the #GVolume object that represents the volume.
 *
 * The other is for implementing a #GVolumeMonitor whose sole purpose
 * is to return #GVolume objects representing entries in the users
 * "favorite servers" list or similar.
 *
 * Returns: (transfer full): the #GVolume object that is the parent for @mount or %NULL
 * if no wants to adopt the #GMount.
 * Deprecated: 2.20: Instead of using this function, #GVolumeMonitor
 * implementations should instead create shadow mounts with the URI of
 * the mount they intend to adopt. See the proxy volume monitor in
 * gvfs for an example of this. Also see g_mount_is_shadowed(),
 * g_mount_shadow() and g_mount_unshadow() functions.
