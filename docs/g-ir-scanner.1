.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBg\-ir\-scanner\fP [OPTION...] FILES...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
g\-ir\-scanner is a tool which generates GIR XML files by parsing headers and
introspecting GObject based libraries. It is usually invoked during the normal
build step for a project and the information is saved to disk and later
installed, so that language bindings and other applications can use it. Header
files and source files are passed in as arguments on the command line. The
suffix determines whether a file be treated as a source file (.c) or a header
file (.h). Currently only C based libraries are supported by the scanner.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show help options
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
If passed, do not print details of normal operation.
.TP
.B \-\-warn\-all
Display warnings for public API which is not introspectable.
.TP
.B \-\-warn\-error
Make warnings be fatal errors.
.TP
.BI \-\-format\fB= FORMAT
This parameters decides which the resulting format will be used. The
default value is gir.
.TP
.BI \-\-include\fB= NAME
Add the specified introspection dependency to the scanned namespace.
NAME is of the form NAMESPACE\-VERSION, like Gtk\-3.0.
.TP
.BI \-\-include\-uninstalled\fB= PATH
Add the specified introspection dependency to the scanned namespace.
This differs from \fB\-\-include\fP in that it takes a file path, and does not
process the pkg\-config dependencies (since they may not be installed yet).
.TP
.BI \-\-add\-include\-path\fB= PATH
Add a directory to the path which the scanner uses to find GIR files. Can
be used multiple times to specify multiple directories
.TP
.BI \-i\fP,\fB  \-\-library\fB= LIBRARY
Specifies a library that will be introspected. This means that the
*_get_type() functions in it will be called for GObject data types. The
name of the library should not contain the leading lib prefix nor the
ending shared library suffix.
.TP
.BI \-L\fP,\fB  \-\-library\-path\fB= PATH
Include this directory when searching for a library. This option can be
specified multiple times to include more than one directory to look for
libraries in.
.TP
.BI \-I\fB directory
Include this directory in the list of directories to be searched for
header files. You need to pass to the scanner all the directories you\(aqd
normally pass to the compiler when using the specified source files.
.TP
.BI \-n\fP,\fB  \-\-namespace\fB= NAME
The namespace name. This name should be capitalized, eg the first letter
should be upper case. Examples: Gtk, Clutter, WebKit.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-libtool
Disable usage of libtool for compiling stub introspection binary. Use this
if your build system does not require libtool.
.TP
.B \-\-libtool
Full path to libtool executable. Typically used for Automake systems.
.TP
.BI \-\-nsversion\fB= VERSION
The namespace version. For instance 1.0. This is usually the platform
version, eg 2.0 for Gtk+, not 2.12.7.
.TP
.BI \-p\fP,\fB  \-\-program\fB= PROGRAM
Specifies a binary that will be introspected. This means that the
*_get_type() functions in it will be called for GObject data types. The
binary must be modified to take a \fB\-\-introspect\-dump=\fP option, and to pass
the argument to this function to g_irepository_dump.
.TP
.BI \-\-program\-arg\fB= ARG
Additional argument to pass to program for introspection.
.TP
.BI \-\-identifier\-prefix\fB= PREFIX
This option may be specified multiple times. Each one gives a prefix that
will be stripped from all C identifiers. If none specified, the namespace
will be used. Eg, an identifier prefix of Foo will export the identifier
typdef struct _FooBar FooBar; as Foo.Bar.
.TP
.BI \-\-symbol\-prefix\fB= PREFIX
This option may be specified multiple times. Each one gives a
prefix that will be stripped from all C symbols. Eg, an symbol
prefix of foo will export the symbol foo_bar_do_something as
Foo.Bar.do_something.
.TP
.B \-\-accept\-unprefixed
If specified, the scanner will accept identifiers and symbols which do not
match the namespace prefix. Try to avoid using this if possible.
.TP
.BI \-\-output\fB= FILENAME
Name of the file to output. Normally namespace + format extension. Eg,
GLib\-2.0.gir.
.TP
.BI \-\-pkg\fB= PACKAGE
List of pkg\-config packages to get compiler and linker flags from. This
option can be specified multiple times to include flags from several
pkg\-config packages.
.TP
.BI \-\-pkg\-export\fB= PACKAGE
List of pkg\-config packages that are provided by the generated gir. This
option can be specified multiple times if the gir provides more packages.
If not specified, the packages specified with \fB\-\-pkg=\fP will be used.
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Be verbose, include some debugging information.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
The g\-ir\-scanner uses the \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS\fP variable to check for dirs, the
girs are located in \fBXDG_DATA_DIRS/gir\-1.0\fP\&. It is normally set on a
distribution so you shouldn\(aqt need to set it yourself.
.sp
The variable \fBGI_SCANNER_DISABLE_CACHE\fP ensures that the scanner will not
write cache data to \fB$HOME\fP\&.
.sp
The variable \fBGI_SCANNER_DEBUG\fP can be used to debug issues in the
build\-system that involve g\-ir\-scanner. When it is set to \fBsave\-temps\fP, then
g\-ir\-scanner will not remove temporary files and directories after it
terminates.
.sp
The variable \fBGI_HOST_OS\fP can be used to control the OS name on the host
that runs the scanner. It has the same semantics as the Python \fBos.name\fP
property.
