GObject introspection is a middleware layer between C libraries (using
GObject) and language bindings. The C library can be scanned at compile time
and generate metadata files, in addition to the actual native C library. Then
language bindings can read this metadata and automatically provide bindings to
call into the C library.

The GI project consists of:

* an XML format called GIR containing introspection information in a machine parseable format
* a Python package to create and parse the GIR format
* a scanner to generate GIR format from C source and headers
* a typelib similar to xpcom/msole which stores the information on disk in a binary format
* a compiler to compile the typelib from a xml format (and vice versa)
* C library to read the typelib, :doc:`writingbindings/libgirepository`.
